Blockchain technology is a decentralized digital ledger system that records transactions across a network of computers in a secure, transparent, and immutable manner. It is the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but its applications extend far beyond digital currencies, including supply chain management, healthcare, finance, voting systems, and more. The technology is characterized by its ability to create trust and transparency without the need for a central authority.

Overview
A blockchain is a chain of blocks, where each block contains a list of transactions. These blocks are linked together using cryptographic hashes, ensuring the integrity of the data. Once a block is added to the chain, it is extremely difficult to alter, making the system resistant to tampering and fraud. The decentralized nature of blockchain means that no single entity has control over the entire network, which enhances security and reduces the risk of centralized failures.

History
The concept of blockchain was first introduced in 2008 by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin whitepaper, "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System." The first blockchain was implemented in 2009 as the public ledger for Bitcoin transactions. Since then, the technology has evolved, with new platforms like Ethereum introducing smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.
