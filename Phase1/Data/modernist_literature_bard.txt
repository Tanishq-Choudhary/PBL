Literary modernism, a dominant movement in Western literature during the early 20th century, represents a radical shift from traditional forms and conventions.

 1  Emerging from a period of rapid industrialization, technological advancement, and widespread social upheaval, modernism sought to capture the anxieties, uncertainties, and fragmented experiences of the modern world. 2  Characterized by a rejection of realism and naturalism, modernist writers experimented with new techniques, including stream of consciousness, interior monologue, and non-linear narratives, to explore the complexities of human consciousness and the breakdown of traditional values. 3  This movement emphasized subjective experience, psychological depth, and the exploration of existential themes, often reflecting a sense of disillusionment and alienation. 1  Notable features include the use of symbolism, ambiguity, and a deliberate fragmentation of form and language, mirroring the perceived fragmentation of modern life itself. 4  Modernist literature also demonstrated a strong interest in exploring the inner workings of the human mind, delving into the subconscious and challenging conventional notions of time and space. Influenced by philosophical and psychological theories, such as those of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, and by the artistic innovations of movements like impressionism and cubism, literary modernism aimed to forge a new aesthetic that could adequately express the complexities and contradictions of the modern era.
