Existentialism is a philosophical movement emphasizing individual existence, freedom, and choice. It posits that existence precedes essence, meaning that humans are born without inherent purpose and must define themselves through their actions. Central to existentialist thought are themes of anxiety, dread, and the absurdity of existence, stemming from the recognition of human freedom and responsibility in a seemingly meaningless universe. This philosophy explores the subjective experience of being, highlighting the individual's confrontation with mortality and the necessity of creating meaning in a world devoid of preordained values. While encompassing diverse perspectives, existentialism generally stresses the importance of authenticity, urging individuals to live genuinely in accordance with their own choices, rather than conforming to external pressures or societal norms.
