Existentialism is a philosophical movement that emerged in the 19th and 20th centuries, primarily in Europe, emphasizing individual existence, freedom, and choice as fundamental to human experience. It arose as a response to the perceived meaninglessness and absurdity of life in a world devoid of inherent purpose or universal values. Key figures in existentialism include Søren Kierkegaard, often regarded as the father of existentialism, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, and Martin Heidegger. Central to existentialist thought is the idea that individuals must create their own meaning and essence through their actions and decisions, as existence precedes essence. Existentialists argue that humans are condemned to be free, meaning that they are thrust into a world without predetermined purpose and must bear the responsibility of defining their own path. This freedom, while empowering, also brings with it anxiety, despair, and the burden of choice. Existentialism explores themes such as authenticity, alienation, the absurd, and the inevitability of death, often through literature, drama, and philosophical discourse. While existentialism is not a unified doctrine, its influence has permeated various fields, including psychology, theology, and the arts, challenging individuals to confront the complexities of human existence and the search for meaning in an indifferent universe.
