Mechanism of Action
CRISPR gene editing relies on the Cas (CRISPR-associated) proteins, primarily Cas9, to cut DNA at specific locations. The process involves:

Guide RNA (gRNA): A custom-designed RNA molecule directs Cas9 to the target DNA sequence.
DNA Cleavage: The Cas9 enzyme acts as molecular scissors, cutting the DNA at the desired site.
DNA Repair: Cells attempt to repair the cut using one of two mechanisms:
Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ): Often introduces small mutations that can disrupt a gene.
Homology-Directed Repair (HDR): Uses a template to precisely insert or modify genetic sequences.

CRISPR Gene Editing
CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) is a revolutionary gene-editing technology that allows scientists to precisely modify DNA in living organisms. Adapted from a natural defense mechanism found in bacteria, CRISPR enables targeted genetic modifications with high efficiency, making it one of the most powerful tools in modern biotechnology.

History and Development
CRISPR technology is based on a bacterial immune system that defends against viral infections. In 2012, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier demonstrated how the CRISPR-Cas9 system could be repurposed for gene editing, earning them the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020. Since then, CRISPR has transformed genetic research and medicine.
