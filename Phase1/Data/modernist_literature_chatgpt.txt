Literary Modernism
Literary Modernism was a movement that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, characterized by a break from traditional narrative forms, experimentation with language and structure, and a focus on subjective experience. Influenced by rapid industrialization, urbanization, and the aftermath of World War I, modernist writers sought to depict the complexities of modern life through fragmented narratives, stream-of-consciousness techniques, and unconventional syntax. The movement was deeply shaped by philosophical developments, including existentialism, psychoanalysis, and a growing skepticism toward absolute truths.

Key figures of literary modernism include James Joyce, whose novel Ulysses (1922) revolutionized narrative form; Virginia Woolf, who explored interior consciousness in Mrs. Dalloway (1925) and To the Lighthouse (1927); T.S. Eliot, whose poem The Waste Land (1922) captured the disillusionment of the post-war era; and William Faulkner, who employed intricate stream-of-consciousness techniques in works like The Sound and the Fury (1929). Other notable modernists include Franz Kafka, Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, and Samuel Beckett.

Modernist literature often rejected linear storytelling and objective omniscient narration in favor of fragmented structures, multiple perspectives, and unreliable narrators. The movement also embraced themes of alienation, existential doubt, and the search for meaning in an increasingly fragmented world. While modernism declined after World War II, giving way to postmodernism, its innovations in literary form and style continue to influence contemporary literature.
