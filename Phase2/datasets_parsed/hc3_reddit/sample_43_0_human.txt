Why do Americans say " Merry " Christmas while other English - speaking countries use the phrase " Happy Christmas " ? What was the origin of this split ? I realized this today when a friend from New Zealand wished me a " happy " Christmas .. Please explain like I'm five.

New Zealanders say Merry Christmas . Source : New Zealander , only ever heard Happy Christmas in Harry Potter .
