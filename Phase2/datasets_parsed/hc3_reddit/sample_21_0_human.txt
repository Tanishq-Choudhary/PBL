How come I can buy a carton of beer for $ 30 which has 24 glass bottles in it ... Yet if I buy 4 wine glasses ( which does n't even come with wine ) it costs over $ 30 ? ? . Please explain like I'm five.

The quality of the glass is different , but more importantly the size of the prodction line , the ease with which you transport a case of beer compared to fragile goods like wine glasses , and you are missing intellectual property rights . Typically , all beer bottles look basically the same and no " real " cost has to be paid to designers . A designer can take a big percentage . Also , there are expensive beers , and cheap wine glasses . You wo n't pay that at IKEA .
