Why do Americans say " Merry " Christmas while other English - speaking countries use the phrase " Happy Christmas " ? What was the origin of this split ? I realized this today when a friend from New Zealand wished me a " happy " Christmas .. Please explain like I'm five.

Seems the Victorians may have objected to the connotation of " merry " meaning " drunk " , so they started using " Happy Christmas " rather than " Merry Christmas " , in the late 19th century : URL_0 > The alternative " Happy Christmas " gained usage in the late 19th century , and in Great Britain and Ireland is the common wish , rather than " Merry Christmas " . One reason may be the Victorian middle class influence in attempting to separate wholesome celebration of the Christmas season from public insobriety and associated asocial behaviour , at a time when merry also meant " intoxicated " – Queen Elizabeth II is said to prefer " Happy Christmas " for this reason.[50 ] In her annual Christmas messages to the Commonwealth , Queen Elizabeth has used " happy Christmas " far more often than " merry Christmas".[55 ]
