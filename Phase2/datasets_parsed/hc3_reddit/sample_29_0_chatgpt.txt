How vulnerable are TOR users . I 'm not literally 5 , and I have a basic knowledge of computers , but I simply ca n't understand [ this ] ( URL_0 ) . How can an attacker deanonymize a victim using this procedure ? Please explain like I'm five.

TOR, or The Onion Router, is a network that allows users to browse the internet anonymously by routing their traffic through multiple layers of servers, or "nodes," before it reaches its destination. This makes it difficult for anyone to trace the traffic back to the original user. 
However, TOR is not completely foolproof, and there are ways that an attacker could potentially deanonymize a victim using the TOR network. One way this could happen is if the attacker is able to compromise a node in the TOR network and monitor the traffic passing through it. If the victim is using a vulnerable device or operating system, the attacker may be able to exploit a security flaw to reveal the victim's IP address or other identifying information. 
Another way an attacker could potentially deanonymize a victim using TOR is by setting up a "fake" node on the TOR network and enticing the victim to connect to it. The attacker could then monitor the victim's traffic and potentially reveal their identity. 
It's important to remember that while TOR can help protect your anonymity online, it is not a guarantee of complete anonymity. It's always a good idea to use caution and take steps to secure your device and protect your personal information when using the internet, whether you're using TOR or not.
