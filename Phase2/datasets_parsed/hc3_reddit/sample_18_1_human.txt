Why are Republicans against giving the LGBT community equality ? I read an article about Democrats wanting to introduce a bill in Congress that would ban discrimination and the like targeted at the LGBT community . For what reasons would conservatives not be in support of this ? Please explain like I'm five.

A lot of Republican voters are conservative Christians who believe that homosexuality is a sin . A Republican politician who supports the LGBT community risks losing their votes . I think that one thing that might help you understand it a little better , from that perspective , being gay is n't just an acceptable difference in someone 's personality , it 's something that 's wrong with them , or that they 're doing wrong . They believe that creating laws that cater to LGBTs encourages it , and causes some sort of national moral decline .
