What did Harry Potter have that made it such a massively successful series ? In other words , what were the factors which lead to the unrivaled success of Harry Potter ? Please explain like I'm five.

It was easy to read , appealed to an audience , and grew up with that audience . The themes in the books got progressively more mature each book . Also , it 's success is hardly " unrivaled " .
