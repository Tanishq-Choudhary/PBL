Why is NASA 's Space / launch center based in Florida ? As compared to any other state . Please explain like I'm five.

- Spacecraft launch eastward , so that the Earth 's rotation helps them get into orbit . Any space launch center will want a giant empty area to the East , so that nobody will get hurt if a rocket explodes or crashes on launch . For the Soviets , that giant empty area was the Kazach steppe and Siberia ; for the Americans it was the Atlantic Ocean . - It 's warm enough that they can launch almost 365 days a year . - It 's relatively close to NASA 's supply contractors , and accessible by barge . This was important because the gigantic Saturn V first stage was only transportable by barge .
