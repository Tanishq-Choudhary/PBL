How come I have to pay for Foxtel and get ads , when things like youtube are free because they play ads . Should n't Foxtel be you pay and you do nt get ads , or it should be free and you get ads . Please explain like I'm five.

Foxtel and YouTube are two different types of services, and they operate in different ways. Foxtel is a subscription-based service, which means you pay a monthly fee to access the content they offer. This content is usually exclusive and not available for free on other platforms. In exchange for this exclusivity and the cost of producing and acquiring this content, Foxtel charges a subscription fee. 
On the other hand, YouTube is a free platform that is supported by advertising. When you watch a YouTube video, you may see ads before, during, or after the video. These ads help YouTube generate revenue, which is used to cover the costs of hosting and streaming the videos on their platform. 
In short, Foxtel charges a fee for access to exclusive content, while YouTube is free but displays ads to generate revenue. Both models have their pros and cons, and it's up to you to decide which one you prefer.
