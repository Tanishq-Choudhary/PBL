Why do the Japanese , who are known for having a conservative culture , seem to have such outlandish media ? Video games , T.V. shows , music , etc . Please explain like I'm five.

A couple of reasons : One , They had a pretty much isolated culture for all of their history , but then WW2 happened and America jammed ourselves straight into their ports and refused to leave , causing all sorts of our pop culture to mix with theirs , but with none of the context behind any of it , so you get stuff like eating KFC on Christmas being such a strong tradition you have to order your christmas chicken months in advance . Second , while they are a lot more conservative on paper , the Japanese tend to be a lot more comfortable with letting people endulge in whatever weird stuff they enjoy than a lot of the west is , as long as it 's kept mostly to the people it concerns . Third , most of the stuff we see is deliberately cherrypicked to be the weirdest stuff they have to offer . For every weird - ass tentacle porn video , there 's plenty more fully normal things we just do n't see . If you want to know more about this sort of thing , you should check out Gaijin Goomba ( URL_0 ) , he makes a lot of videos about these sort of things .
