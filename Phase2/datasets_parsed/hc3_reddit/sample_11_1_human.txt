How does depression work in the brain ? And is it more physical of psychological ? ( Both cause and symptoms ) Please explain like I'm five.

No one really knows what causes depression . There 's debate about whether depression is a single disease or several diseases with similar symptoms . Most antidepressants work on the neurotransmitters serotonin , norepinephrine , and/or dopamine . There is also evidence that drugs targeting the NMDA receptor can also be effective . People respond to all sorts of different drugs . Even more confusingly , people who do not respond to one serotonin drug may do well on a different serotonin drug . People do have physical symptoms such as fatigue , weakness , appetite changes , etc . If these symptoms are driven by the brain or if they come from some other mechanism is n't really known either . There are some diseases like Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Fibromyalgia which have a strong statistical relationship with mental health disorders such as depression , but we do n't understand the root cause enough to say for sure how they are related .
