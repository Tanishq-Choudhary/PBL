What does LSD do ? Seeing as though its in the news about it and weed being the same . Please explain like I'm five.

LSD (Lysergic acid diethylamide) is a powerful hallucinogenic drug that can cause changes in a person's perception of reality, thoughts, and emotions. It is often taken in the form of small squares of paper that have been soaked in the drug. When someone takes LSD, they may experience hallucinations, which are vivid and distorted perceptions of things that are not really there. They may see, hear, and feel things that are not real. They may also have altered perceptions of time and space, and may feel disconnected from their own body. It is important to note that LSD can be very unpredictable, and the effects can vary greatly from person to person. It is also important to note that LSD is illegal in many countries, and it is not safe to use.
