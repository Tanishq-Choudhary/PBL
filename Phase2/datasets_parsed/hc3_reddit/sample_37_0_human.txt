Why does my pizza box say preheat oven , when I can just put it in for a couple minutes longer and it 's the same thing ? It also says ( keep pizza frozen while preheating ) , what difference does that make ? Please explain like I'm five.

Pizza companies want you to keep coming back to their pizzas , so they add foolproof instructions . People have different ovens , so " cooking " while preheating is going to have random results , and they just ca n't tell people to do that if they have terrible ovens .
