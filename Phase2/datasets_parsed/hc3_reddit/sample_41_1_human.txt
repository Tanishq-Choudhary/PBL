Where do movies find newborn babies ? I have always thought that maybe they are just fake or some lady really let them use her newborn Please explain like I'm five.

Good question ... I 'll bet you would n't have to put too many people in a room and one of them would know someone who just had a baby ? So the movie producers just come across them without advertising , " Wanted : Newborn , promise to return promptly " . some lady hired out her newborn more likely ? The babies must get paid for their ' work ' ?
