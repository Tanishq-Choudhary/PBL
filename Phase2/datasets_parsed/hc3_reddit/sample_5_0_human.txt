Melanin ! Many of the the first known humans existed in the fertile crescent - modern day Iraq and surrounding areas , and it was just as sunny and hot as it is today . Melanin causes skin and eyes to have a darker color , and as a benefit reduced the amount of UV radiation absorbed into the skin . Eventually humans expanded into less hot and sunlit areas allowing for the survival and procreation of people who developed lighter colored eyes and skin because of the lack of need of melanin for survival .
