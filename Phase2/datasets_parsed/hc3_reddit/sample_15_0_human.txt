Why are we forced to use banks to receive our income ? Obv not including illegal / off the books cash in hand work and that sort of thing .. Edit : It 's a pity people inside america are so stupid . Please explain like I'm five.

You 're not . You can use a credit union , or take your check to a check - cashing store .
