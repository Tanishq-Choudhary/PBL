Is it true that glands in the breast that have produced milk can not get cancer ? How so ? My professor told the class this tidbit . Never heard it before . Please explain like I'm five.

ANY cell can get cancer . Your professor is likely citing a statistic that suggests that breastfeeding lowers chances of cancer significantly , but I think it 's naive to say milk production completely stops cancer development . Cancer is a specific mutation of your cells that basically means your cells are n't told to die anymore . They grow uncontrollably . I 'm not sure of the correlation between breastfeeding ( or milk production ) and cancer growth , but * all * cells can mutate in this way . It 's just that ; like smoking increases the risk of this mutation , so can breastfeeding reduce that risk . Frighteningly , * anyone * can develop cancer . But , to bring this full circle , I do n't see how producing milk necessarily would stop cancer development on its own .
