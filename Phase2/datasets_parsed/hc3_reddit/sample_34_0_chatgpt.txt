why are stormclouds gray when normal clouds are white ? Should nt it just be water particles in both cases ? Please explain like I'm five.

Storm clouds are gray because they contain a lot of water droplets that are very close together. When light from the sun or other sources passes through these droplets, it scatters in all directions. This is what makes the clouds appear white. 
However, storm clouds are often much denser and contain a lot more water droplets than normal clouds. This means that more light is scattered in all directions, which can make the clouds appear darker. This is why storm clouds are often gray. 
Normal clouds are white because they also contain water droplets, but these droplets are farther apart from each other. This means that less light is scattered in all directions, which makes the clouds appear white. 
Overall, the color of clouds is determined by the amount of water droplets they contain and how these droplets scatter light. Storm clouds appear gray because they contain a lot of water droplets that scatter a lot of light in all directions, while normal clouds appear white because they contain fewer water droplets that scatter less light.
