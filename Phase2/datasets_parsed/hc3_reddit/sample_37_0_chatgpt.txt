Why does my pizza box say preheat oven , when I can just put it in for a couple minutes longer and it 's the same thing ? It also says ( keep pizza frozen while preheating ) , what difference does that make ? Please explain like I'm five.

Preheating the oven is important because it ensures that the oven has reached the proper temperature before you start cooking your pizza. If you put the pizza in an oven that is not hot enough, it will take longer to cook and the crust may not turn out as crispy as you'd like. 
As for the instructions to keep the pizza frozen while preheating the oven, this is probably because the pizza will cook more evenly if it goes into the oven frozen. When the pizza is frozen, the heat of the oven will thaw and cook it gradually, rather than going straight from cold to hot and potentially cooking unevenly. 
Overall, following the instructions on the pizza box (such as preheating the oven and keeping the pizza frozen) can help you achieve the best possible results when cooking your pizza.
