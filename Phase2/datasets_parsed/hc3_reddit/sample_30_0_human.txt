How come I have to pay for Foxtel and get ads , when things like youtube are free because they play ads . Should n't Foxtel be you pay and you do nt get ads , or it should be free and you get ads . Please explain like I'm five.

It used to be ad free , it was launched on that as a premise . The simplest answer I can give is profit .
