what are use taxes?

Use tax is a tax on the use of goods or certain services in a jurisdiction where the goods or services are not taxed by the seller. Use tax is generally imposed by a state or local government and is typically calculated at the same rate as the sales tax that would have been charged if the sale had occurred within the jurisdiction. Use tax is intended to level the playing field between in-state and out-of-state sellers and prevent consumers from avoiding sales tax by purchasing goods or services from out-of-state sellers.\n\nUse tax is generally imposed on goods or services that are used, stored, or consumed in the jurisdiction, regardless of where the goods or services were purchased. For example, if a business located in a state with a sales tax buys goods from an out-of-state seller and uses the goods in the state, the business may be required to pay use tax on the purchase.\n\nUse tax may also be imposed on certain services, such as repair or maintenance services, that are performed in the jurisdiction.\n\nIndividual consumers may also be required to pay use tax if they purchase goods or services from out-of-state sellers and use the goods or services in a jurisdiction that imposes a use tax. In some cases, individual consumers may be required to report and pay use tax on their personal income tax return.\n\nIt is important to note that use tax is generally not imposed if the goods or services are taxed by the seller at the time of sale. In other words, use tax is generally not imposed if the seller charges sales tax at the time of sale.\n
