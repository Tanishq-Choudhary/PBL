what is the cabin pressure of us airlines

The cabin pressure on most commercial airliners in the United States is typically maintained at a pressure equivalent to an altitude of around 8,000 feet (2,438 meters) above sea level. This is done to help passengers feel more comfortable during the flight by reducing the effects of the high altitude on the human body. The cabin is pressurized to this level to make it easier to breathe and to reduce the risk of altitude-related health issues such as hypoxia. The actual cabin pressure will vary slightly depending on the specific aircraft and the altitude at which it is flying. Some newer aircraft have pressurized cabins that are maintained at an even lower altitude equivalent, such as around 6,000 feet (1,829 meters).
