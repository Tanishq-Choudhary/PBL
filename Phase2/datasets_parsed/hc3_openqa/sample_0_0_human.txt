what composer used sound mass

Composers and works include Barbara Kolb , Pauline Oliveros ' Sound Patterns for chorus (1961), Norma Beecroft 's From Dreams of Brass for chorus (1963–1964), and Nancy Van de Vate .A very early example is the opening of Jean-Féry Rebel 's ballet Les Elémens (1737–38), where chaos is represented by a gradually cumulating orchestral cluster of all seven notes of the D minor scale (Henck 2004, pp. 52–54).A later example is the third movement of Ruth Crawford Seeger 's String Quartet 1931 (Nonesuch H-71280) while more recently Phill Niblock 's multiple drone based music serves as an example.The use of "chords approaching timbres" begins with Debussy and Edgard Varèse often carefully scored individual instrumental parts so that they would fuse into one ensemble timbre or sound mass (Erickson 1975, pp. 18 and 21).Other examples include European "textural" compositions of the fifties and sixties such as Krzysztof Penderecki 's Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima (1959) and György Ligeti 's works featuring micropolyphony in works like Atmosphères (1961) and his Requiem (1963-65).Other composers with works using this technique include Henryk Górecki , Karel Husa , Witold Lutosławski , Kazimierz Serocki , and Steven Stucky .Sound mass techniques also appear in the music of George Crumb (Anon. n.d.).
