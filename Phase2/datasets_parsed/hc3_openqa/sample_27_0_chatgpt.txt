What kind of personality test is the MBTI

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a self-report personality questionnaire designed to measure psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. The test is based on the theory of psychological types developed by Carl Jung and later expanded upon by Katherine Briggs and her daughter, Isabel Briggs Myers.\n\nThe MBTI assessment consists of a series of questions that ask individuals to describe their preferences in various areas, such as how they prefer to interact with others, how they prefer to process information, and how they prefer to make decisions. Based on their responses, individuals are assigned a four-letter code that represents their personality type, such as INTJ (Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Judging) or ENFP (Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Perceiving).\n\nThe MBTI is often used in a variety of settings, including education, career counseling, and leadership development. While it has been widely used and is popular in many circles, it has also been the subject of criticism and controversy. Some researchers have questioned the validity and reliability of the MBTI, and it should not be used as the sole basis for making important decisions.
