how does a dim sum restaurant work

In a dim sum restaurant, customers are typically seated at tables and served small plates of food called "dim sum" that are traditionally served in steamer baskets or on small plates. The dim sum dishes are usually made up of a variety of steamed or fried dumplings, buns, and other small bites, often with a variety of fillings such as meat, seafood, vegetables, and sweets.\n\nTo order dim sum, customers are typically given a menu or list of dishes to choose from, and they can select as many or as few dishes as they like. The server will then bring the dishes to the table, and the customer pays for the food as it is served.\n\nIn some dim sum restaurants, the server may also push a cart or tray around the restaurant, offering customers a variety of dim sum dishes to choose from. Customers can simply point to the dish they want, and the server will place it on the table.\n\nIn many dim sum restaurants, the atmosphere is lively and social, with friends and families gathering to eat and chat over small plates of food. Dim sum is often served as a shared meal, with everyone at the table trying a little bit of everything.
