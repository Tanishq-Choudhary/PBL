where are colors on stoplight

On a typical stoplight, the colors are arranged in a vertical line, with red on top, yellow in the middle, and green on the bottom. The red light is usually used to indicate that a driver should stop, while the yellow light is used as a warning that the light is about to turn red and that the driver should prepare to stop. The green light indicates that it is safe for the driver to proceed. The colors and their meanings are standardized around the world, making it easy for drivers to understand the signals regardless of where they are driving.
