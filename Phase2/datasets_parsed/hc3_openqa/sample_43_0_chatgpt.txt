what is lean manufacturing and who developed

Lean manufacturing is a production philosophy that emphasizes the minimization of waste and the maximization of value. The goal of lean manufacturing is to create a highly efficient and effective production process that delivers the highest quality products to customers in the shortest time possible, while using the least amount of resources.\n\nLean manufacturing was developed by Toyota Motor Corporation in the 1950s, based on the principles of the Toyota Production System (TPS). TPS was developed by Taiichi Ohno, who is often referred to as the father of lean manufacturing. The TPS is a manufacturing approach that aims to eliminate waste, reduce variability, and increase efficiency by standardizing work processes and continuously improving them.\n\nOver the years, the principles of lean manufacturing have been adopted by a wide range of industries, including automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and electronics. The concept has also been applied to service industries, such as banking, insurance, and government agencies, to improve efficiency and effectiveness.
