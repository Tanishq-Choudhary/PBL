how is rfid tag powered

RFID tags can be powered in a few different ways:\n\nPassive RFID tags: These tags do not have their own power source and are activated by the radio frequency energy transmitted by the RFID reader. The energy from the reader is used to power the microchip in the tag and transmit the stored data back to the reader.\n\nActive RFID tags: These tags have their own power source, usually a small battery, which is used to power the microchip and transmit the stored data to the reader.\n\nSemi-passive RFID tags: These tags have a small battery that is used to power the microchip, but the tag is still activated by the radio frequency energy transmitted by the reader. The energy from the reader is used to amplify the signal from the tag's microchip, allowing it to be read at a greater distance.\n\nOverall, the power source for an RFID tag depends on the specific type of tag and the intended application.
