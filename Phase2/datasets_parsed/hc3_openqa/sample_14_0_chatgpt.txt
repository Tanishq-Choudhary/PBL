What is Ischemia or infarction?

Ischemia refers to a reduction in blood flow to a particular tissue or organ. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as blocked arteries, narrow or damaged blood vessels, or low blood pressure. When ischemia occurs in the brain, it is called a stroke. Ischemia can also occur in other organs, such as the heart (which is called a heart attack or myocardial infarction) or the legs (which is called peripheral artery disease).\n\nInfarction refers to the death of tissue due to a lack of blood flow. This can occur when ischemia is prolonged and the tissue does not receive enough oxygen and nutrients. Infarction is most commonly used to refer to a heart attack, but it can also refer to a stroke or the death of tissue in other organs or limbs.\n\nIschemia and infarction can be serious medical emergencies and can have serious complications if not treated promptly. Treatment may include medications to improve blood flow, such as aspirin or blood thinners, as well as procedures to restore blood flow, such as angioplasty or stenting.\n
