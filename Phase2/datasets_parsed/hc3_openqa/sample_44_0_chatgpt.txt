what is metformin used for

Metformin is a medication that is used to treat type 2 diabetes. It belongs to a class of medications called biguanides. Metformin works by decreasing the amount of sugar produced by the liver and increasing the sensitivity of muscle cells to insulin, which helps the body use sugar more effectively. It is usually taken orally in the form of a tablet or liquid, and is usually taken once or twice a day with meals. Metformin is often used in combination with other medications and lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, to lower blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. It is also sometimes used off-label to treat other conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
