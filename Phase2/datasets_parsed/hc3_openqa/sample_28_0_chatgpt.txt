where does ground pepper come from

Ground black pepper is made from the dried, ground fruits of the pepper plant, which is native to India. The pepper plant, also known as Piper nigrum, is a woody, climbing vine that is grown in tropical regions around the world. The fruit of the pepper plant, known as the peppercorn, is harvested when it is ripe and then dried in the sun or by mechanical means. Once dried, the peppercorns are ground into a fine powder to produce ground black pepper. There are other types of pepper as well, such as white pepper and green pepper, which are made from different parts of the pepper plant and processed differently.
