where is testosterone produced

Testosterone is a hormone produced primarily by the testicles in men and the ovaries in women, although small amounts are also produced by the adrenal glands in both sexes. In men, testosterone is essential for the development and maintenance of male characteristics, such as facial hair, deep voice, and muscle mass. It also plays a role in sexual function, including sex drive and sperm production. Testosterone levels can be measured through a blood test and can be influenced by various factors, including age, diet, and physical activity.
