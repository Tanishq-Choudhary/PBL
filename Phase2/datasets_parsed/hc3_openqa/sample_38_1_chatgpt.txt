what is extreme right wing

Extreme right wing refers to a political ideology that is characterized by a strong commitment to traditional social and cultural values, authoritarianism, and opposition to progressive or liberal ideas. It often involves a belief in the superiority of one's own group or nation and a mistrust of outsiders and minority groups. Extreme right wing ideologies may also involve hostility towards democracy and support for authoritarian or dictatorial forms of government. Some extreme right wing ideologies, such as fascism and Nazism, are associated with violence, racism, and persecution of minority groups. It is important to note that these views are generally considered to be outside the mainstream of political thought and are rejected by the vast majority of people.
