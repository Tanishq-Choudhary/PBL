what is atherosclerotic heart disease

Atherosclerotic heart disease is a type of heart disease that is caused by the buildup of plaque in the arteries that supply blood to the heart. This plaque, which is made up of cholesterol, fatty substances, and other materials, can narrow or block the arteries, reducing the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart. As a result, the heart may not receive enough oxygen and nutrients to function properly, leading to chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, and other symptoms. In severe cases, the lack of blood and oxygen can lead to a heart attack, in which the heart muscle is damaged or dies. Atherosclerotic heart disease is a common condition that can be prevented or managed through lifestyle changes, medication, and other treatments.
