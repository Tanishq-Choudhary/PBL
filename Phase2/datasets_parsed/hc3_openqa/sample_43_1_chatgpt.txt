what is lean manufacturing and who developed

Lean manufacturing is a production philosophy that aims to minimize waste and optimize efficiency in the manufacturing process. It was developed by Toyota Motor Corporation in the 1950s and 1960s, and has since been adopted by companies in a variety of industries around the world.\n\nThe core principles of lean manufacturing include identifying and eliminating waste (also known as "muda") in the manufacturing process, using just-in-time production to minimize inventory, and empowering workers to identify and solve problems in the production process. These principles are designed to help companies produce high-quality products at a lower cost, while also improving customer satisfaction and responsiveness.\n\nThere are many tools and techniques that companies can use to implement lean manufacturing, including value stream mapping, kanban systems, and visual management. By adopting a lean philosophy, companies can improve their efficiency, reduce waste and costs, and increase competitiveness.
