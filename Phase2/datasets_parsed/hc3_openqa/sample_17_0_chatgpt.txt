what is middle class in the us

In the United States, the term "middle class" refers to a socio-economic group that falls between the upper class and the lower class. It generally includes people who have a certain level of education and income, as well as a certain level of occupational prestige.\n\nThere is no exact definition of what constitutes the middle class, and the concept can vary depending on the context and the specific criteria used to define it. Some common criteria used to define the middle class include income, education level, occupation, and lifestyle.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, a common definition of the middle class in the United States is a household with an income that is two-thirds to double the national median household income. In 2021, the national median household income was $68,703, so a household with an income of $45,802 to $137,406 would be considered middle class, based on this definition. However, this is just one way to define the middle class, and other definitions and criteria may be used.
