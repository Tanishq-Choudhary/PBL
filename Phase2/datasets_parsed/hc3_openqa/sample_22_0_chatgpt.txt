what does karma mean in buddhism

In Buddhism, karma refers to the concept of cause and effect. It is the idea that every action, whether physical or mental, has consequences that can affect the future of the person who performed the action.\n\nAccording to the teachings of Buddhism, the consequences of an action are not necessarily determined by a higher power or deity, but rather by the natural laws of the universe. Every action creates a chain of events that can have positive or negative effects on the person who performed the action, as well as on those around them.\n\nIn Buddhist teachings, the consequences of an action are not limited to the present life, but can extend into future lives. This is because Buddhists believe in the concept of reincarnation, in which the consciousness of a person is reborn after death into a new body. Therefore, the actions and choices that a person makes in this life can have an impact on their future lives.\n\nKarma is seen as a natural law, like the law of gravity. It is not a punishment or reward system imposed by a deity, but rather a consequence of one's actions. The goal in Buddhism is not to accumulate good karma, but rather to be mindful of one's actions and to cultivate a compassionate and caring attitude towards all beings, which can ultimately lead to a state of enlightenment.
