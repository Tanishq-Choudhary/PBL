What was "Freedom Summer"?

"Freedom Summer" was a campaign in the United States in 1964 to register African American voters in Mississippi. It was organized by civil rights organizations, including the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and was supported by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).\n\nDuring the summer of 1964, hundreds of student volunteers from around the country, both black and white, traveled to Mississippi to work on voter registration and other civil rights issues. The campaign was met with violent resistance from segregationist whites, and several Freedom Summer activists were killed or went missing. Despite the challenges and dangers, the campaign was successful in increasing voter registration among African Americans in Mississippi and helped to pave the way for the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
