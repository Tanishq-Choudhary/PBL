The exact date of Black Friday varies from year to year, but it is always on the fourth Friday in November. In 2021, Black Friday will be on November 26. It is important to note that Black Friday deals and promotions are often available both in-store and online, and some retailers may start their sales earlier or extend them for a longer period of time.
