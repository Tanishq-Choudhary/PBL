where does ground pepper come from

Ground black pepper is made from the dried, ripe fruit of the Piper nigrum plant, which is native to the tropical forests of India and other parts of Southeast Asia. The fruit, known as peppercorns, are harvested when they are fully ripe and then dried in the sun or by mechanical means. Once dried, the peppercorns are ground into a fine powder to produce ground black pepper.\n\nWhite pepper is also made from the Piper nigrum plant, but it is produced differently. The peppercorns are harvested before they are fully ripe, and then they are soaked in water to soften the outer skin. The skin is then removed, and the remaining peppercorn is dried and ground into a fine powder to produce white pepper.\n\nBoth black and white pepper have been used for centuries as a spice and as a medicine in various parts of the world. They are popular for their pungent flavor and are widely used in a variety of dishes and cuisines around the world.
