where did the persian war take place

The Persian Wars were a series of conflicts fought between the Greek city-states and the Persian Empire in the 5th century BC. The wars took place mainly in the western and central regions of Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), as well as in other parts of the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea. The Persians, led by their kings Xerxes I and Darius I, sought to expand their empire and bring the Greek city-states under their control. The Greeks, led by the city-states of Athens and Sparta, resisted the Persian invasions and eventually succeeded in defeating them. The wars had a significant impact on the development of western civilization and the growth of the Greek city-states.
