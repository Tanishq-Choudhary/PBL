what does karma mean in buddhism

Karma ( Sanskrit , also karman, Pāli : Kamma) means "action" or "doing"; whatever one does, says, or thinks is a karma.In Buddhism , the term karma is used specifically for those actions which spring from the intention (Sanskrit: cetanā , Pali: cetana) of an unenlightened being.As one scholar states, "the Buddhist theory of action and result (karmaphala) is fundamental to much of Buddhist doctrine, because it provides a coherent model of the functioning of the world and its beings, which in turn forms the doctrinal basis for the Buddhist explanations of the path of liberation from the world and its result, nirvāṇa ."
