what forms seasons

Seasons are caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis as it orbits the sun. The Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of about 23.5 degrees relative to its orbit around the sun. This tilt causes different parts of the Earth to receive different amounts of solar energy throughout the year, resulting in the cycle of seasons.\n\nDuring the winter months, the North Pole is tilted away from the sun, causing the northern hemisphere to receive less direct sunlight and experience colder temperatures. Conversely, during the summer months, the North Pole is tilted towards the sun, causing the northern hemisphere to receive more direct sunlight and experience warmer temperatures.\n\nThe same process occurs in the southern hemisphere, but with the opposite seasons. When it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer in the southern hemisphere, and vice versa.\n\nThe length of the seasons and the amount of temperature variation they produce can vary depending on the latitude of a particular location. Locations closer to the poles experience more extreme seasons, with longer, colder winters and shorter, warmer summers. Locations closer to the equator experience less extreme seasons, with more consistent temperatures throughout the year.
