how is rfid tag powered

Some tags are powered and read at short ranges (a few meters) via magnetic fields ( electromagnetic induction ).Others use a local power source such as a battery, or else have no battery but collect energy from the interrogating EM field, and then act as a passive transponder to emit microwaves or UHF radio waves (i.e., electromagnetic radiation at high frequencies).Battery powered tags may operate at hundreds of meters.
