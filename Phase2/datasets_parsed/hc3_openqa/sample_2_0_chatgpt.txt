what are add ons

Add-ons, also known as extensions or plug-ins, are small software programs that can be installed into a larger software application to add specific features or functionality. They are typically designed to enhance or customize the capabilities of the main application.\n\nAdd-ons can be used in a variety of software applications, including web browsers, productivity tools, and media players. For example, you might install an add-on in your web browser to block pop-up ads, or install an add-on in your productivity tool to add a new feature or integration with another service.\n\nAdd-ons can be installed through the main application's interface, or downloaded from the internet and installed manually. Some add-ons are free, while others may require a purchase or subscription fee.
