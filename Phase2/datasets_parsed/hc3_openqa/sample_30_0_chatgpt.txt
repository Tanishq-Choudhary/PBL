where do the mohawks live

The Mohawk people, also known as the Kanien'kehá:ka, are a Native American and First Nations people who originally lived in what is now known as the Northeastern United States and southeastern Canada, specifically in the area around the Mohawk River in present-day New York. They were part of the Iroquois Confederacy, a group of six nations that included the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora.\n\nToday, many Mohawk people still live in this region, particularly in New York and Ontario. However, there are also Mohawk communities in other parts of the United States, Canada, and even internationally.
