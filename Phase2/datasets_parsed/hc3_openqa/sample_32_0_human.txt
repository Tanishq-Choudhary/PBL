What is an economic feature?

Other broad distinctions include those between positive economics (describing "what is") and normative economics (advocating "what ought to be"); between economic theory and applied economics ; between rational and behavioral economics ; and between mainstream economics (more "orthodox" and dealing with the "rationality-individualism-equilibrium nexus") and heterodox economics (more "radical" and dealing with the "institutions-history-social structure nexus").Economic analysis may be applied throughout society, as in business , finance , health care , and government, but also to such diverse subjects as crime, education , the family , law , politics , religion , social institutions , war, and science .At the turn of the 21st century, the expanding domain of economics in the social sciences has been described as economic imperialism .
