What did Harry Potter have that made it such a massively successful series ?  Please explain like I'm five.  It 's honestly the same basic story that 's been told for centuries .  We all attended primary school / middle school / high school , so it 's easy to recognize the awkward initial kiss , the school bully and the teacher everyone hated .  A savior / chosen one arrives on the scene to save the world .  In other words , what were the factors which lead to the unrivaled success of Harry Potter ?  I think what separates Rowling is that even though her story is in a particularly fantastical universe , it 's still relatable to all ages .  Like other very successful spins on this basic story ( eg , Lord of the Rings , Star Wars , The Hunger Games ) , its success stems from Rowling 's ability to create a unique world and populate it with characters we can root for and against .  And who would n't want to attend Wizarding school at Hogwarts , play Quidditch , drink Butterbeer , and learn how to cast spells to thwart our enemies ?  Middle school in particular is one of the more awkward , miserable times for most people and Rowling offered an alternate reality where school is actually fun , your best friends really are forever and you are empowered to actually change things .
