Why are Republicans against giving the LGBT community equality ?  Another reason may be due to a belief in traditional gender roles and sexual orientations.  One reason may be due to their religious beliefs.  Please explain like I'm five.  It's likewise possible that some conservatives may simply not understand or agree with the experiences and perspectives of the LGBT community, and therefore may not support equal rights for them.  In fact, several Republicans support equal rights for the LGBT community.  Some conservatives may believe that there are only two genders (male and female) and that people should only be attracted to members of the opposite sex.  I read an article about Democrats wanting to introduce a bill in Congress that would ban discrimination and the like targeted at the LGBT community .  However, there are some conservatives who may not support equal rights for the LGBT community for a variety of reasons.  They may therefore oppose laws that would give equal rights to those who do not fit into these traditional gender roles or sexual orientations.  It's crucial to note that not all Republicans are against giving the LGBT community equality.  Some conservatives may believe that being gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender goes against their interpretation of certain religious texts, and therefore they may oppose laws that would give these groups equal rights.  For what reasons would conservatives not be in support of this ?  Overall, it's important to remember that there are several diverse viewpoints on this issue, and that not everyone may agree on the best way to ensure equal rights for all people, including those in the LGBT community.
