Is it true that glands in the breast that have produced milk can not get cancer ?  How so ?  Frighteningly , * anyone * can develop cancer .  Please explain like I'm five.  ANY cell can acquire cancer .  I 'm not sure of the correlation between breastfeeding ( or milk production ) and cancer growth , but * all * cells can mutate in this way .  Your professor is likely citing a statistic that suggests that breastfeeding lowers chances of cancer significantly , but I think it 's naive to say milk production completely stops cancer development .  They grow uncontrollably .  Never heard it before .  My professor told the class this tidbit .  Cancer is a specific mutation of your cells that basically means your cells are n't told to die anymore .  It 's just that ; like smoking increases the risk of this mutation , so can breastfeeding reduce that risk .  But , to bring this full circle , I do n't see how producing milk necessarily would stop cancer development on its own .
