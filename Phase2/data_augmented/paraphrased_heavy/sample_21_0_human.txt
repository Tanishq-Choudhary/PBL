How come I can buy a carton of beer for $ 30 which has 24 glass bottles in it ...  Please explain like I'm five.  Yet if I buy 4 wine glasses ( which does n't even come with wine ) it costs over $ 30 ?  Also , there are expensive beers , and cheap wine glasses .  .  The quality of the glass is different , but more importantly the size of the prodction line , the ease with which you transport a case of beer compared to fragile goods like wine glasses , and you are missing intellectual property rights .  A designer can take a big percentage .  ?  Typically , all beer bottles look basically the same and no " real " cost has to be paid to designers .  You wo n't pay that at IKEA .
