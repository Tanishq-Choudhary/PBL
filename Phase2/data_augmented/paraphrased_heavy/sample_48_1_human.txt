Why have gas prices gone down ?  As well , there are other factors that are at play as well .  There are lots of reasons .  Germany appears to be on the edge of a recession , which could tumble other EU states with it , and recessions tend to slow demand .  Please explain like I'm five.  Why have gas prices in the last few months plummeted and continue to do so ?  Probably two of the biggest are that demand goes down between the summer months , which lowers prices , and refiners do n't have to put in the " summer blend " additives which help combat pollution .  It 's seasonal , and prices will surge a bit for the winter when it gets cold and then drop off again in the spring before going back up again in the summer .  There has been a lot of investment in non - oil fossil fuels over the past decade ( specifically natural gas ) which have some similar applications in consumption and have had a downward effect on over - all oil prices .
