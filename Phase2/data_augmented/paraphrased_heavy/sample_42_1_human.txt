What does LSD do ?  But seriously , it latches onto a specific serotonin receptor subtype ( 5 - HT2A ) and activates it .  Seeing as though its in the news about it and weed being the same .  I do n't consider the process is fully understood , but this inhibits activity in the part of the brain associated with logic and the ego ; not ego in the sense of self - esteem , but ego in the sense of recognizing oneself as a separate entity from one 's surroundings .  Please explain like I'm five.  It does great things .  It additionally increases activity in the part of the brain associated with emotion and creativity .
