Where do movies find newborn babies ?  The babies used in movies and TV shows are typically a few weeks or months old, and they are usually accompanied by a parent or guardian on set.  Movies and TV shows often use newborn babies as actors for scenes that require a baby to be shown on screen.  The babies are carefully supervised by the production team and are only used for short periods of time to ensure their safety and well-being.  In some cases, filmmakers may apply props or special effects to create the appearance of a newborn baby on screen, rather than using a real baby.  This can be done using dolls, animatronics, or computer-generated imagery (CGI).  I have always thought that maybe they are just fake or some lady really let them use her newborn Please explain like I'm five.  These babies are usually provided by baby casting agencies, which are companies that specialize in finding and hiring babies and young children for roles in the entertainment industry.  However, it is often more realistic to utilize real babies when they are needed in a scene.
