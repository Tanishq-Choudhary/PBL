Why I can not fabricate a religion that prevents me from going to school , then cite my foremost amendment rights when I am charged ?  Thanks !  Specifically to keep you from doing dumb shit like this .  Please explain like I'm five.  Since you 're a minor and your parents get to make that choice for you .  Prevents me from going to school by having , for example , supposed prayer times that coincide with school hours .  Now go to bed , you are going to school tomorrow .
