What does LSD do ?  Please explain like I'm five.  Be careful .  Very , particularly , very different drugs .  Seeing as though its in the news about it and weed being the same .  I have had amazing experiences , but bad as well .  I would n't classify it as a recreational drug , it really is more of a spiritual experience that needs to have the right setting and place , as well as state of mind .  Something that provides a bit of a positive reset to your state of mind when done appropriately .
