What will happen to the United States economy as our debt increases and we continue to ignore it ?  Since our current deficit is at around this level , there is virtually nothing to get concerned about .  Once you accept that , then move to- there will always be an economy in the US which will generate economic activity that can be taxed .  Given our historical growth rate , most people regard we could have debt growth of about 3 % per year ( ~480 billion ) and never reach this point , because the growth in the economy via inflation , population growth and true growth allows the economy to expand to meet the increased debt levels .  US debt is denominated in its own currency which it has the ability to issue , if needed , ( there would be consequences to doing it , but is always plausible ) therefore default on US debt is functionally impossible .  I remember in the 80 's under reagan when with an economy 1/3 its current size we were running deficits of 250 billion ..  What if we do n't ?  Given this , there will always be income available to service ( pay interest on ) debt .  The question is how much will be available- only when the size of the interest payments become too great will it cause any noticeable effect on the economy , due to services will have to be cut or taxes increased .  Will we eventually have to pay it off ?  Much misinformation regarding this , Do n't regard of sovereign debt as similar to household debt , it 's not .  Please explain like I'm five.  or equivalent to nearly a trillion today- and everyone was expressing doom and gloom .
