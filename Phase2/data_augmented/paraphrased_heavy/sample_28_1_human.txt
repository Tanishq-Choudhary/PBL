Is it true that glands in the breast that have produced milk can not get cancer ?  My professor told the class this tidbit .  How so ?  Never heard it before .  Your professor may be testing to observe if you 'll actually call them on their shit .  I say you should thoroughly research the topic and call BS .  Please explain like I'm five.  Either that , or they 're full of shit .  Either they will be impressed and congratulate you or be pissed and reveal just what sort of asshole they are .
