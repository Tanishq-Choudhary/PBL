Why does the Double Jeopardy Clause exist ?  The Double Jeopardy Clause is a part of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Please explain like I'm five.  For example, if new evidence is discovered that was not available at the time of the original trial, it may be possible to bring someone to trial again for the same crime.  It states that no person shall "be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.  It also helps to prevent the government from using its power to try to punish someone over and over again until it gets the result it wants.  The Double Jeopardy Clause is designed to protect people from being subjected to the stress and expense of multiple trials for the same crime.  Nevertheless, there are some exceptions to the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Why are you not allowed to prosecute someone when they been pronounced not guilty , when new evidence has been found ? " This means that if someone is acquitted (found not guilty) of a crime, they cannot be tried again for the same crime.  Additionally, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply in cases where the crime was committed in different states or in cases where the person was tried in both a state court and a federal court.
