Why does mixing lights result in a different color than mixing paint ?  When you mix red and green paint together, the resulting color is a brownish color due to the pigments in the paint are absorbing all of the colors of light except for brown.  Please explain like I'm five.  For example, red paint reflects red light and absorbs other colors.  This is since light is made up of different wavelengths of energy, and when you mix two colors of light together, you are adding the wavelengths of energy together.  for example green + red = yellow in lights , and brown in paint .  why does this happened .  Mixing various colors of light actually does result in a various color, just like mixing paint does.  When you mix two colors of paint together, the pigments in the paint absorb certain wavelengths of light and reflect others.  The difference is in how our eyes and brains interpret the colors.  On the other hand, when you mix two colors of light together, like red and green, the resulting color is a bright yellow because the light is actually adding together.  So, the reason why mixing paint results in a different color than mixing light is as paint absorbs certain wavelengths of light, while light adds distinct wavelengths of energy together.
