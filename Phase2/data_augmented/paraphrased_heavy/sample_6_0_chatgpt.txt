Why I can not fabricate a religion that prevents me from going to school , then cite my foremost amendment rights when I am charged ?  In the case you described, going to school is not a matter of personal belief or religious practice.  The First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the freedom of religion, which means that you have the right to believe and practice whatever religion you choose.  Even if you tried to claim that your religion prevents you from going to school, the government has the right to regulate certain activities that could interfere with the education of children or the functioning of schools.  By not going to school, you would be breaking the law and could be charged for truancy or failing to comply with compulsory education laws.  It is a legal requirement for children of a certain age to attend school in order to receive an education.  Please explain like I'm five.  Prevents me from going to school by having , for example , supposed prayer times that coincide with school hours .  However, this freedom is not absolute and can be limited in certain circumstances to protect the rights and safety of others.  Thanks !  The government has a compelling interest in ensuring that children receive a proper education, and the First Amendment does not protect actions that would disrupt or interfere with this important goal.  So, while you have the right to freely practice your religion, you still have to follow the laws and regulations that apply to everyone else, including those related to education.
