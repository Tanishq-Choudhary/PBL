Why is every book I hear about a " NY Times # 1 Best Seller " ?  Should n't there only be one " # 1 " best seller ?  I guess even if you do n't stay there for long , you still achieved the status .  ELI5 : Why is every book I hear about a " NY Times # 1 Best Seller " ?  Replace " Best Seller " by something like " Oscars " and every " best seller " book is basically an " oscar - winning " book .  Some you might not be best seller one week , but you may be the next week .  Basically there are various categories of " Best Seller " .  Please explain like I'm five.  Same thing for best sellers .  May not have won the " Best film " , but even if you won the best director or best script , you 're still an " oscar - winning " film .  Also , IIRC the rankings change every week or something like that .  Hence , # 1 best seller .
