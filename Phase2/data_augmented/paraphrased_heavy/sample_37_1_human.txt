Why does my pizza box say preheat oven , when I can just put it in for a couple minutes longer and it 's the same thing ?  Same if you have a super powerful commercial oven vs a wimpy old one , or a huge cavernous oven vs one a pizza can barely fit in .  Please explain like I'm five.  They will take various amounts of time to heat up , cooking the pizzas distinct amounts .  So they 'll never be able to give you exact times like they do .  If your pizza thaws to room temperature initial , they do nt comprehend what your room temperature is or how long it 's out and how close it gets to room temperature , so they ca n't account for that .  They are giving you a controlled experience .  If your pizza is frozen until it gets into an oven already heated to a precise temperature , it will heat the same way every time .  It furthermore says ( keep pizza frozen while preheating ) , what difference does that produce ?  In addition , cooking for a long time at low temperatures actually has separate effects on your ingredients than cooking fast at a high temperature , so you gain a slightly different result , although with most pizzas it 's hard to notice .
