Why the same products / brands have differents names in various countries ?  Finally, some companies simply choose to use diverse names for their products in different countries in order to appeal to different markets.  for example : USA - Crest ; Europe - Blend - a - Med Feel free to give some more examples :) Please explain like I'm five.  One reason is that various countries often have diverse languages, and it can be easier for people to recognize and remember a brand name if it is written in their own language.  There are a few reasons why the same products or brands might have different names in various countries.  In order to comply with these laws, companies might need to use different names for their products in various countries.  Both brands construct toothpaste, but they have diverse names because they are marketed to people who speak different languages.  Another reason why products might have different names in different countries is because different countries have distinct regulations about what can be sold and how it can be marketed.  For example, some countries have laws that require products to have certain types of labels or warning messages, or that prohibit certain types of advertising.  For example, Crest is a brand of toothpaste that is popular in the United States, and Blend-a-Med is a brand of toothpaste that is popular in Europe.  For example, a company might use a more traditional or classic name for its products in one country, and a more modern or trendy name in another country, in order to better match the preferences of consumers in those markets.
