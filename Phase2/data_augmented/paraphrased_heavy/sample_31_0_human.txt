How did pirates / navy track down other ships back before radar / sonar ?  There are only so many ports , and the bigger a ship the bigger a port it needs to be able to dock .  they really did nt .  Or he might wait for a ship to dock and become a sitting target in an undefended port .  A pirate might wait in the shipping lanes a day or two outside of a busy port and wait for a target .  It 's not possible to track steps through ocean .  A third choice is to cruise near nautical choke points like between islands or outside sandbars .  Once a ship was in sight it was then just a matter of who was the better seaman , or which ship was to windward , and in many cases some luck .  Large convoys of vessels moreover usually took predictable routes , there was a range of a few degrees which offered the fastest trip to and from Europe due to trade winds and currents , and ships tried to avoid sailing in storm and hurricane season so there tended to be a fine deal of activity when it was optimal for sailing .  Please explain like I'm five.  But often you knew where ships were likely to be .  I wondered this while watching Pirates of the Caribbean and wondered how ships chased each other down ?  Ships might be in sight but 20 miles away and still be in a chase .
