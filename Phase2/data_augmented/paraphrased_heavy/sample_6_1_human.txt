Why I can not fabricate a religion that prevents me from going to school , then cite my initial amendment rights when I am charged ?  Please explain like I'm five.  Thanks !  Prevents me from going to school by having , for example , supposed prayer times that coincide with school hours .  You can choose not to have your children enrolled in school without any reason .  You just have to sign up and do what the jurisdiction requires to fulfill the home schooling regulations .
