Why does mixing lights result in a different color than mixing paint ?  for example green + red = yellow in lights , and brown in paint .  why does this happened .  Red paint absorbs green and blue light , and reflects red .  Paint , on the other hand , is about absorption and reflection .  Yellow paint absorbs blue light , and reflects red and green .  Mixing light together is simple addition .  Please explain like I'm five.  Adding red light to green light gives you yellow light , add in blue and obtain white light .  Mix them together and you acquire a paint that absorbs blue light , absorbs half of green light and reflects the other half , and reflects red : orange paint .
