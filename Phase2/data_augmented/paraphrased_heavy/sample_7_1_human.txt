What has changed that we frequently now throw away products instead of fixing them ?  Please explain like I'm five.  Is it the quality or nature of the products themselves , or more cultural in origin ?  You can engineer a product to be maintainable or you can engineer it to always be using parts that are a much higher cost to produce ( making you prefer replacing it ) .  planned obsolescence is the term .  Disposable technology is cheaper to create and more profitable for the company that makes it .
