Add-ons can also be used in other types of software, such as word processors or productivity tools, to add novel features or functionality. \n\nIt's critical to be careful when installing add-ons, as they can potentially pose security risks or cause compatibility issues with the main application.  They can also be called extensions, plugins, or modules.  It's a great idea to only install add-ons from reputable sources and to be mindful of any permissions the add-on requests before installing it.
