Why has nobody assassinated Kim Jong - un He is such a pest and nuisance to basically the entire world except for China .  Angela Merkel ?  Who 's next ...  Please explain like I'm five.  every country , every world leader would be a potential target .  Castro ?  The international condemnation would be brutal .  Why has n't anyone had him assassinated yet ?  Even though noone likes Kim Jong - Un , and everyone thinks North Korea is pretty shitty to its citizens , if say the US were to send agents over ( and do n't regard they are n't capable of it ) and they got caught ....  You ca n't just go around assassinating the leaders of countries you do nt like !  Anyways , rumour has it that he 's ultra paranoid about exactly that and travels around in tanks and armoured trains that make Limo 1 look like a tonka toy .
