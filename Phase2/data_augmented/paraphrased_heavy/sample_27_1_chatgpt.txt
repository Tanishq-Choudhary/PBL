What kind of personality test is the MBTI The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a personality assessment tool that is based on the theory of psychological types developed by Carl Jung. \n\nThe MBTI assessment is typically administered through a series of self-report questions that ask the individual to choose between two opposite preferences.  Thinkers tend to rely more on logic and objective analysis, while feelers tend to rely more on their values and subjective emotions.  It is designed to help individuals understand their own personality characteristics and how they interact with others.  Feeling: This dimension refers to how people tend to produce decisions.  Perceiving: This dimension refers to how people tend to approach the outside world.  Judgers tend to be more organized and structured, while perceivers tend to be more flexible and spontaneous.  Introversion: This dimension refers to how people tend to orient themselves towards the outside world and receive their energy.  Intuition: This dimension refers to how people process information and make decisions. \n\nThe MBTI has been widely used in a variety of settings, including business, education, and counseling, to help individuals better understand their strengths, challenges, and communication styles.  Extraverts tend to be more outgoing and get energized by interacting with others, while introverts tend to be more introspective and acquire energized by spending time alone. \n\nSensing vs. \n\nThinking vs.  Based on their responses, the individual is assigned a four-letter code that represents their personality type, such as INTJ (introverted, intuitive, thinking, judging) or ENFP (extraverted, intuitive, feeling, perceiving).  Sensors tend to rely more on their five senses and practical, concrete information, while intuitives tend to rely more on their imagination and abstract, theoretical ideas. \n\nThe MBTI consists of a series of questions that assess four dimensions of personality:\n\nExtraversion vs. \n\nJudging vs.  Still, it should be noted that the MBTI is not a scientific or statistically validated measure, and its reliability and validity have been called into question by some researchers.
