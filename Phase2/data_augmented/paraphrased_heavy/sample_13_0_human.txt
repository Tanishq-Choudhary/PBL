What is a " Tor exit node " or " Tor node " What is a " Tor exit node " or " Tor node " ?  The entire idea behind tor is that by bouncing your information through different relay points , each of which is secured and the data transfers between them are encrypted , thus making your communications much harder to trace back to you .  This has the effect of making you appear like your in another place and posses a different IP address then you actually do .  Simply put , a Tor node is one of the small parts of the jump that obfuscates your physical location and IP address by bouncing your information .  I 'm going to go off the assumption that you do n't know what tor is , if you do then feel free to skip the next paragraph .  My request is sent from my computer , to my ISP 's servers , to the servers of the website and then takes the little bit of information , lets say a specific webpage , and then does that same process in reverse .  Please explain like I'm five.  If I turn on my computer and use a regular browser , lets say Firefox , my computer requests that a specific bit of information from , lets say , reddit .  An exit node is a tor node that serves as the ' exit ' point from the tor network and sends the actual request for information from the site .  Taking the information from the servers of the website to the ISP 's servers and then back to my computer .  Tor complicates this process by , rather then doing a straight line of data from computer to ISP to site , first encrypting all the communication and then secondly bouncing that signal / request for data around before submitting the request for information .  Hopefully that clears this up , if you have anymore questions just ask .
