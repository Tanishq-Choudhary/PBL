If salt is so bad for cars , why do we use it on the roads ?  As the title states , why do we implement it ?  Please explain like I'm five.  is there no other option or what ?  salt is good for not dying in car crashes and car crashes are worse for cars then salt .  Some places use other things , but salt is really cheap compared to most alternatives , although sand is pretty excellent .
