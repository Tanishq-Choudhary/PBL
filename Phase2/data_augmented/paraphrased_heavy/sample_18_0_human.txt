Why are Republicans against giving the LGBT community equality ?  I read an article about Democrats wanting to introduce a bill in Congress that would ban discrimination and the like targeted at the LGBT community .  Please explain like I'm five.  From a political perspective , a large voting block for the Republican party are older and extremely religiously conservative ( Usually Christian , specifically protestant ) .  For what reasons would conservatives not be in support of this ?  The more conservative forms of Christianity do not favor homosexuality .  If the Republican party were to openly support protections for homosexuals ( and others that fall into LGBT categories ) they risk alienating an important voter block , which affects their reelection chances and political power .
