Why is NASA 's Space / launch center based in Florida ?  This is one of the problems that [ the Soviet Union ] had with Baikonur [ Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan ] , their launch site .  And the location that they chose in Florida had a lot to do with the fact that there was n't anything there .  As compared to any other state .  But there was no population density whatsoever .  You go there today and you do n't see it , but Brevard County in the 1940s was a bunch of orchards and hardly anything else .  I mean , it is in the middle of nowhere .  Please explain like I'm five.  So you could build what you wanted , but it had decent roads due to of the military , and that was important .  One was , it 's close to the equator .  Florida was chosen for several major reasons .  And this island that they 're on [ Merritt Island ] had good logistics , owing to there was a navy base and an army base not too far away . —Editor 's Note ] The second reason was it had to be on the east coast , over the ocean , so you would n't fly over people that might receive killed as stuff dropped off or blew up .  [ The linear velocity of Earth 's surface is greatest at the equator , much as a ceiling fan blade slices through the air faster at its tip than at its center hub , conferring a fuel - saving boost to spacecraft attempting to escape Earth 's gravity.  It was just a beach , essentially .  They had to build a whole infrastructure to run rail out there , to build highways , to bring in all of the water and power and everything else that was necessary to make that place habitable .
