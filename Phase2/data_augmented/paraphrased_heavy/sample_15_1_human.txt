Why are we forced to use banks to receive our income ?  Edit : It 's a pity people inside america are so stupid .  It 's much easier for an employer to keep all of it 's money in their bank than to go withdraw whatever they owe you and hand it to you every two weeks .  Please explain like I'm five.  Obv not including illegal / off the books cash in hand work and that sort of thing ..  If you use direct deposit , it 's a lot easier for you too .
