Why does the Double Jeopardy Clause exist ?  Why are you not allowed to prosecute someone when they been pronounced not guilty , when new evidence has been found ?  Please explain like I'm five.  Say there is a DA that has a real hard on for putting you behind bars .  You go to trial , not guilty .  To avoid vicious prosecution .  So he just tries you again and again until he gets the outcome he was looking for .  Particularly simplified answer , but the easiest to give !
