What will happen to the United States economy as our debt increases and we continue to ignore it ?  What if we do n't ?

Right now , economists do n't percieve the debt as much of an issue , we do n't realize how much is " too much debt " but what is going on right now , they generally agree is the right move .  Sorta , this " debt " is not the same as household debt .  What if we do n't ?  Please explain like I'm five.  --eventually this wo n't be the case , but no one is really sure when that will be .
