Why do movie companies build sets rather than film on scene ?  Also , if you 're filming in a public area it 's hard to stop the public from wandering in or watching from as close as possible .  If you 're filming a movie over the course of a year , you might be able to shut down an area for a few days of shooting , but if you need that space often you 're not going to be able to shut down a park or roads every few days .  Seems like any location will do and seems like it 's cheaper to find an existing location rather than building their own .  They want a specific look , so they build a set to fit that look .  Most of the time , any location wo nt do .  And if you have to destroy something .....  Please explain like I'm five.  Or there s nothing like it nearby , and it 's cheaper than paying everyone to live somewhere else for the length of the shoot .  moreover , they can build the set without certain walls or in certain ways so camera angles that are n't possible in real places you can suddenly do .  Likewise , many public places simply ca n't be close off that long .  But I 'm open to being wrong .  or have something loud and noisy or distracting ...
