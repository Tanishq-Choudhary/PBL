What has changed that we frequently now throw away products instead of fixing them ?  Some products are designed in a way that makes them difficult or impossible to repair.  This can be influenced by things like the availability of cheap, modern products and the convenience of being able to just buy a new item instead of trying to fix the old one.  In some societies, it is more common or acceptable to throw away things that are broken or no longer wanted, rather than trying to repair them or give them to someone else who might be able to employ them.  Another factor is cultural in origin.  This can happen if the product is very old or if the parts needed to fix it are hard to find or very expensive.

For example, if a product is made with very cheap materials or is put together in a way that makes it hard to access the parts that need to be repaired, it may be easier or cheaper to just throw it away and buy a new one rather than try to fix it.  In these cases, it might construct more sense to just buy a new product instead of trying to repair the old one.
