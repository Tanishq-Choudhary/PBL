Why do movie companies build sets rather than film on scene ?  if you want to shoot a night scene in the day or vice versa .  Seems like any location will do and seems like it 's cheaper to find an existing location rather than building their own .  But I 'm open to being wrong .  Lighting and camera placements . e.  Please explain like I'm five.  Those lights required for filming are massive and can be extremely tricky to maneuver into a real room -- also , natural light flooding in from the windows can wreck havoc with your scene placement -- i.  Another thing are the cameras , boom mics etc , in a set , you can remove walls , shoot from above the fake ceiling , shoot from below the fake floor , etc .  In a real room , you are particularly constrained on where you can place the camera and where the actors can stand .  As for outside scenes , most studios have fake " street sets " looking like a generic NYC or LA street , or fake industrial settings , or caves / wilderness settings so that you do n't have to fly the actors , crew , and your equipment every time your script calls for a scene change .
