What are prions and are they a enormous deal ?  A prion is a special kind of deformed protein .  Please explain like I'm five.  My AP Biology teacher mentioned them alongside viruses but he did n't say much else beyond that they are n't viruses and they deform protein structure .  When it comes in contact with normal proteins , it causes them to deform in the same way .  So not only are the proteins deformed will no longer to their jobs , they spread the deformity to other proteins .
