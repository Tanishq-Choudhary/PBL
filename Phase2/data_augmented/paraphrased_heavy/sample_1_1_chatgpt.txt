where did the persian war take place The Persian Wars, also known as the Greco-Persian Wars, were a series of conflicts fought between the Greek city-states and the Achaemenid Empire of Persia in the 5th century BCE.  The wars took place primarily in the western and eastern regions of the Aegean Sea, and also in the region of Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) and the Black Sea.  The Persians also invaded and occupied parts of Greece during the wars, including the city of Athens, which was ultimately able to repel the Persians with the help of its allies.  The main theater of the conflict was the region of Ionia, located on the coast of modern-day Turkey, where the Greeks and Persians clashed over control of the region.  The wars ended in 449 BCE with the signing of the Peace of Callias, which recognized the independence of the Greek city-states and ended the threat of further Persian invasions.
