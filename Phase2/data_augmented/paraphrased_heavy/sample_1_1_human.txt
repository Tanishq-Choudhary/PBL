If salt is so bad for cars , why do we employ it on the roads ?  In Minnesota and North Dakota , they tend to employ sand , not salt .  Please explain like I'm five.  is there no other option or what ?  In these states , though , it is cold enough that the salt can not actually melt the snow , and so it refreezes and you end up with black ice on the roads , which is counterproductive .  As the title states , why do we use it ?  In other states whether there is snow but not so cold , wet asphalt is better than gritty snow for traction and so salt is favored for safety .  Most people who live in states where salt is used , and by the way furthermore in coastal cities , know that washing the car a couple times a week is critical .
