The differences between flash and HTML5 Which one is better for me as a user ?  It describes what elements are in the page and how they 're organized ( elements such as text , images , buttons and links ) .  Please explain like I'm five.  HTML5 introduces many other new features , but these are the ones that are most relevant to this discussion ( HTML5 vs Flash ) .  These tags could be used to display graphics and videos without the need for an external plugin , and were handled by the browser and not by the plugin .  HTML is the language that websites are written in .  They are really quite different .  On the contrary , Flash is no longer supported by Apple 's devices , and by Android 's stock browser .  The main advantage of HTML5 is that it 's a standard that 's supported ( or should be supported ) by every browser .  One such common plugin was Flash , which was basically another small program that runs inside your browser ( another such plugin is Java which can display Java Applets , but they 're hardly in apply anymore ) .  Nonetheless , HTML originally did n't include the ability to indicate graphics , animations or videos ( other than pre - rendered images and animated gifs ) .  HTML did provide the ability to include embedded objects , which would require the user to install a plugin that could display them .  So developers could apply Flash to create things like games ( such as the ones you 'll find in URL_0 ) and video players ( such as YouTube ) .  HTML5 introduces modern features to HTML , mainly the support for the < canvas > and < video > elements .  Another disadvantage of Flash is that it 's considered slow and inefficient .
