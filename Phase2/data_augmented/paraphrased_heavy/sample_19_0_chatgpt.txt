Why we experience the sensation of falling in our dreams / when we wake up Title basically says it all .  The sensation of falling in dreams is actually a very common experience and can be caused by a variety of factors.  In some cases, the sensation of falling may be part of the dream content and may be related to the dreamer's feelings or emotions.  This sensory information may be incorporated into our dreams and may contribute to the vividness and realism of the dream experience.  One reason people may experience this sensation is due to changes in their body position while they are sleeping.  Finally, the sensation of falling in dreams may be related to the way our brains process and interpret sensory information while we are asleep.  Why is it so seemingly universal and why is it so vivid relative to other physical sensations we experience in our dreams ?  This can trigger a reflex that causes you to feel like you are falling or to experience a sensation of vertigo.  What causes this sensation ?  During sleep, our brains are still receiving and processing sensory information from our surroundings, even though we are not consciously aware of it.  Another reason people may experience the sensation of falling in their dreams is due to changes in their brain activity while they are sleeping.  When you are lying down, your body is in a state of relative stillness.  However, if you move or shift positions while you are sleeping, your body may perceive this movement as falling.  Please explain like I'm five.  During the dreaming stage of sleep, known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the brain is more active and may produce vivid and sometimes strange or surreal dreams.  Overall, the sensation of falling in dreams is a normal and common experience that is caused by a combination of factors related to body position, brain activity, and sensory processing during sleep.
