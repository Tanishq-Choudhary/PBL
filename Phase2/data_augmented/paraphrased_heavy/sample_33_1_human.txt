Why is Monsanto considered to be such an evil company by so numerous people ?  Please explain like I'm five.  What are they currently doing ?  No one is forced to buy the seeds ; they just have to honor their contract if they do .  Terminator genes : never been used commercially , and no plans to do so .  What have they done ?  Forcing farmers to buy new seeds every year : this has been common practice for a long time , GMO or not , with practically every seed company .  Because people like to bandwagon , and there 's a ton of misinformation and sensationalist / Huge Organic - funded articles and documentaries out there .  A few that come to mind : Suing farmers over their fields being cross - pollinated : bullshit , based on a case where a farmer had some of his field cross - pollinated with a glyphosphate - resistant strand , and then * intentionally * sprayed all his crops with glyphosphate to kill off the non - resistant ones .  General anti - GMO sentiment : GMOs have to undergo strict testing before being brought to market , while non - GMO ( including [ mutation - bred ] ( URL_0 ) ) strains have little to none .  Now watch me get accused of being a shill .
