What are prions and are they a big deal ?  Normally, proteins have a specific shape that helps them do their job.  They are made up of proteins, which are important building blocks in the body.  But prions are abnormal proteins that have a separate shape, and they can cause other proteins around them to change shape too.  Please explain like I'm five.  Prions are not viruses, and they do not contain any genetic material (like DNA or RNA) like viruses do.  My AP Biology teacher mentioned them alongside viruses but he did n't say much else beyond that they are n't viruses and they deform protein structure .  Instead, they are thought to be able to change the shape of proteins by acting as a kind of template for other proteins to copy.  Prions are tiny particles that can cause serious and often fatal diseases in people and animals.  There is currently no cure for prion diseases, and they can be difficult to diagnose.  These diseases can be transmitted through contaminated food or medical equipment, but they can furthermore occur spontaneously in some people.  When this happens, it can cause problems in the body owing to the proteins are not able to work properly.  Prion diseases can be very serious and are often fatal.  Some examples of prion diseases include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, also known as "mad cow disease") in cows.  Researchers are working to better understand how prions cause disease and to find ways to prevent and treat these conditions.
