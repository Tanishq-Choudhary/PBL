why are stormclouds gray when normal clouds are white ?  It is just water particles , but stormclouds are thicker , and they completely block out the sun .  Should nt it just be water particles in both cases ?  Please explain like I'm five.  When it 's raining and you look up , you 're not seeing the clouds , you 're seeing the shadow of the clouds .
