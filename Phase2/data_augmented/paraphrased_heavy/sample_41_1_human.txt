Where do movies find newborn babies ?  I have always thought that maybe they are just fake or some lady really let them apply her newborn Please explain like I'm five.  Excellent question ...  some lady hired out her newborn more likely ?  So the movie producers just come across them without advertising , " Wanted : Newborn , promise to return promptly " .  I 'll bet you would n't have to put too several people in a room and one of them would realize someone who just had a baby ?  The babies must get paid for their ' work ' ?
