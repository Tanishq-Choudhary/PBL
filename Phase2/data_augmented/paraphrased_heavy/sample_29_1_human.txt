How vulnerable are TOR users .  I 'm not literally 5 , and I have a basic knowledge of computers , but I simply ca n't understand [ this ] ( URL_0 ) .  DON'T PERFORM ILLEGAL ACTIONS .  If after 3 or 4 BUSINESS days have passed , and no postman / postmaster / cop / fed has showed up ...  AGREE that you got a suspicious package , and were n't sure what to do with it ...  It just showed up .  With that being said from my understanding it 's commonly accepted that TOR alone is n't safe enough .  Let me start with this I'M NOT A LAWYER OR AN IT PROFESSIONAL Now that we got that out of the way .  I 'll explain to you my understanding ( which could be particularly wrong ) There have been rumors that the FBI , DEA , and NSA have some part in TOR , and as such it is compromised , and is no safer then the regular web .  Please explain like I'm five.  !  I have n't seen evidence to confirm that however that does n't mean it 's not true .  use escrow .  !  Apply bitcoin only ....  How can an attacker deanonymize a victim using this procedure ?  you never requested it .  Implement ESCROW !  Using Starbucks internet rather than you 're home connection could n't hurt additionally .  !  Also ....  viewing illegal materials / purchasing illegal materials is a whole other story .  From what I understand just browsing the deep web is n't illegal ....  Not for at least 3 business days .  !  Use Escrow .  Once said package arrives ( Do n't apply your name .  Anyone comes snooping around asking about a suspicious package ....  You have to follow to a T their instructions to generate sure you are running things exactly as they say ie no flash , etc .  Any decent vendor will know this moreover ) When the box comes bring it in but do n't open it .  In addition to that most people recommend using VPN .  you should be ok .  THEY ARE ILLEGAL .
