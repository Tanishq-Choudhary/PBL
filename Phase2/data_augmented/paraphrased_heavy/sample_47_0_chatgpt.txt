What happens to the weapons and gear of fallen soldiers ?  Please explain to to me what happens to all this excess military equipment .  In some cases, the equipment may be donated to other countries or organizations that need it.  From my inferences in modern conflict you ca n't just leave AK 's in a foreign country because civilians can acquire them .  It is important to keep track of and properly dispose of military equipment as it can be dangerous if it falls into the wrong hands.  When soldiers are killed in conflict, their weapons and gear are often collected and returned to their home country or military base.  The gear, such as clothing and other equipment, is also collected and either cleaned or repaired for reuse or discarded if it is not in good condition.  Please explain like I'm five.  The weapons are typically taken out of service and either destroyed or stored for later utilize.  Overall, the goal is to make sure that the equipment is used responsibly and safely, and to ensure that it is not used to harm others.
