Why does mixing lights result in a different color than mixing paint ?  No new wavelengths are added .  Please explain like I'm five.  Paints and pigments use a subtractive color model .  why does this happened .  Thus when you have a red and green light , your eyes are receiving both red and green bands of light .  In this case , the material absorbs some wavelengths and reflects others .  Sources of light utilize what 's called an additive color model .  Thus mixing colored paints , it will absorb more colors , causing fewer wavelengths to be reflected back .  Each source adds recent wavelengths , thus the collective light is the sum of all sources .  for example green + red = yellow in lights , and brown in paint .  If mathematically inclined , think of additive sources as a union and substractive pigments as an intersect .
