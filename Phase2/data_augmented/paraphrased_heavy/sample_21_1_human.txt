How come I can buy a carton of beer for $ 30 which has 24 glass bottles in it ...  Yet if I buy 4 wine glasses ( which does n't even come with wine ) it costs over $ 30 ?  ?  Please explain like I'm five.  It 's like comparing golf clubs to baseball bats .  .  Not only is it an issue of quality , it 's an issue of what people are willing to pay .  Separate production costs , different customers , etc .
