Why do movie companies build sets rather than film on scene ?  Cost: While it may seem like it would be cheaper to film on location, this is not always the case.  3.  Renting a location can be expensive, especially if the filmmakers need to use it for an extended period of time.  This can be especially important if the story takes place in a fantastical or fictional world, or if the filmmakers want to create a specific mood or atmosphere.  Please explain like I'm five.  Control: Building a set allows the filmmakers to have complete control over the look and feel of the environment in which they are shooting.  Additionally, the filmmakers may not have access to all of the resources they need on location, such as electricity, water, or special equipment.  4.  Filming on location can involve dealing with hazards such as traffic, unstable terrain, or inclement weather.  Safety: Finally, building a set can be safer for the cast and crew.  There are a few reasons why movie companies might choose to build sets rather than film on location: 1.  Logistics: Filming on location can also be logistically challenging.  Additionally, the filmmakers may need to pay to implement certain locations, or they may have to pay to have the location altered in some way to suit their needs.  Seems like any location will do and seems like it 's cheaper to find an existing location rather than building their own .  The filmmakers may need to deal with crowds, noise, and other distractions, which can form it difficult to acquire the shots they need.  But I 'm open to being wrong .  2.  By building a set, the filmmakers can create a controlled environment where these hazards are minimized.  Overall, building sets can be more expensive upfront, but it can also be more cost-effective in the long run, as it allows the filmmakers to have greater control over their shooting environment and reduce the risk of delays or unexpected costs.
