What has changed that we frequently now throw away products instead of fixing them ?  Is it the quality or nature of the products themselves , or more cultural in origin ?  It require human time and effort and unique problem solving skills depending on the issue .  This has always been expensive , and is still expensive today .  Please explain like I'm five.  It 's three fold : * Stuff is cheaper to mass produce now then it used to be , making it easy to replace something * Fixing something that 's broken is almost always not a mass - production task .  * Many things today are completely impossible for the average person to fix , often not due to people trying to prevent it , but because things are so complicated today , that it 's nearly impossible to be able to fix all the kinds of things you utilize , compared to 200 years ago when you only used a tiny set of tools and items which were all relatively simple .
