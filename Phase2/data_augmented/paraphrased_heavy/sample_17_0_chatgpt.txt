What will happen to the United States economy as our debt increases and we continue to ignore it ?  If a country has too much debt, it can be difficult for it to borrow money in the future and investors may be less likely to lend it money.  What if we do n't ?  This is called a debt repayment plan.  Please explain like I'm five.  This means that it can afford to pay back its debts over time.  In the case of the United States, the government has a lot of debt, but it also has a strong economy and is able to borrow money at low interest rates.  This means that it would not be able to produce the required payments to its lenders and could potentially lead to financial problems for the country.  It's crucial for countries to try to pay off their debts, but it's not always possible to do it all at once.  It's essential for countries, just like people, to manage their debts responsibly.  This can create it harder for the country to fund things like infrastructure, education, and healthcare.  Instead, they might make a plan to gradually pay off their debts over time.  Will we eventually have to pay it off ?  If a country is not able to pay off its debts, it could default on its loans.  Nonetheless, it's still important for the government to be careful about how much it borrows and to try to live within its means as much as possible.
