Why has nobody assassinated Kim Jong - un He is such a pest and nuisance to basically the entire world except for China .  Please explain like I'm five.  It would n't really do any good .  Why has n't anyone had him assassinated yet ?  It 's not like North Korea would instantly convert to freedom - loving democracy if he died .
