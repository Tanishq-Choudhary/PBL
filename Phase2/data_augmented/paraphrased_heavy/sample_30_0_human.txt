How come I have to pay for Foxtel and obtain ads , when things like youtube are free as they play ads .  Should n't Foxtel be you pay and you do nt acquire ads , or it should be free and you get ads .  Please explain like I'm five.  It used to be ad free , it was launched on that as a premise .  The simplest answer I can give is profit .
