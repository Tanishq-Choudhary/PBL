Pro - Union vs.  Please explain like I'm five.  What I understand of my company is that I construct much more money than my unionized counterparts at other company locations and my benefits are far superior .  For instance if my line is down due to of an electric motor and there are 4 bolts that mount it to the floor .  We produce a larger quantity and higher quality product as well because we do n't have senseless union red tape that allows us to perform our jobs efficiently .  In a union shop I would have to wait for an available mechanic to remove any bolts or fasteners so that I could remove the wires .  Anti - Union arguments .  I can do whatever it takes to compete the task .  Why is there so much controversy in America surrounding support or opposition of unions ?  If I were to do it myself to gain it back running and make the company more profitable I would be fined or fired for taking work from another worker 's " craft " and violating the union contract .
