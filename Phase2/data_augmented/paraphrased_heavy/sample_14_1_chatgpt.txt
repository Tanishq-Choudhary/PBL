What is Ischemia or infarction? \n\nInfarction refers to the death of cells or tissue due to a lack of oxygen and nutrients caused by ischemia.  Ischemia refers to a reduction in blood flow to a particular part of the body, usually a organ or tissue.  Infarction can occur in any part of the body, but it is most commonly associated with the heart (heart attack) and brain (stroke).  This can occur when the blood vessels that supply blood to the area become narrowed or blocked, preventing oxygen and nutrients from reaching the cells.  Ischemia can be caused by a number of factors, including plaque buildup in the blood vessels, blood clots, and inflammation.  Infarction can be a serious medical condition that requires immediate treatment to prevent further tissue damage or death.
