magic the gathering What is it .  Magic was invented , I want to say around 1994 , and was the initial playable trading card game of its kind .  Each player starts with 20 life points , and typically loses when they are reduced to 0 life points .  etc I have been hearing more and more about it , and after last nights South Park episode I became curious what it is ..  I personally have known players as young as 8 or 9 , and as old as people in their 30 's and 40 's .  These spells are powered by a type of energy called mana , which is typically drawn from land .  Basically , the premise is that you 're a wizard fighting other wizards using magic spells .  Please explain like I'm five.  Its format inspired more mainstream games , like Pokemon and Yugioh .  These spells can be used to summon creatures to fight for you , to help you and your creatures , or to harm your opponent and his creatures .  The culture behind it ..  There are five colors of mana , which represent the fundamental themes of the game .  how popular is it .  etc .  who plays it .  White represents order and justice , green represents nature and strength , red represents war and chaos , black represents death and self destruction , blue represents illusion and deception .
