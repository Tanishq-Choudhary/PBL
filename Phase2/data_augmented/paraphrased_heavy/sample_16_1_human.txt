Why can does bark what seems like forever but people can only scream for a hour or two ?  I mean some dogs wo n't shut up and constantly yap .  Please explain like I'm five.  Probably the dog has time to breathe in between barks .  Screaming without stopping does n't allow you to catch your breath .
