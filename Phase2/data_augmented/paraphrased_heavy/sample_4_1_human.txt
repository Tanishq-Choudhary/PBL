How was airplane technology able to advance so quickly after the Wright Brothers ' first flight ?  Mainly interested in how aviation was able to be deployed on a large scale during WWI .  Please explain like I'm five.  Eventually , those chains of discovery start to play out , and the rate of advancement slows down , and may even come to a halt , perhaps starting up again years later when somebody discovers something new .  That opens a whole FLOODGATE of discovery leading to discovery , and the technology leaps forward quickly .  The * theory * of transistors had actually been known since the early 20th century , but nobody had figured out a way to actually build one .  We saw the same phenomenon with the building of the first transistor in 1947 .  This is a frequent phenomenon with technology : something is considered remarkably hard or even impossible for a long , long time , and then one day , somebody figures it out .  That led to an explosion in electronics , and when somebody figured out how to put a shitload of teensy transistors on a silicon wafer , the explosion exploded .
