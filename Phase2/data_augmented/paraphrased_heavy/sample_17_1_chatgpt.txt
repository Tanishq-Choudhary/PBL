what is middle class in the us The concept of "middle class" is somewhat subjective and can vary depending on the context and the specific criteria used to define it.  Based on this definition, a household earning between approximately $45,800 and $137,400 would be considered middle class.  They may not be among the highest earners in society, but they have a higher standard of living than those in the lower class. \n\nIn terms of income, the middle class is often defined as households that earn between two-thirds and double the median household income for a given area.  For example, in 2021, the median household income in the United States was approximately $68,700.  Nevertheless, in the United States, the middle class is generally considered to be a group of people who have a moderate amount of income, education, and wealth. \n\nIt is worth noting that the cost of living can vary significantly from one region of the country to another, so what constitutes as "middle class" in one area may be different from what it is in another area.  Additionally, other factors such as education, occupation, and lifestyle may also be used to define the middle class.
