Why the same products / brands have differents names in various countries ?  Crest is actually sold as Crest in the UK , but Blend - a - Med was already an established toothpaste brand in parts of Europe , that Procter and Gamble acquired , and they used the name as it was familiar to their target market .  In other cases , it might be that the name means something undesirable .  In some cases , it might be that a name just does n't read well the way that native speakers of the local language might pronounce it .  for example : USA - Crest ; Europe - Blend - a - Med Feel free to give some more examples :) Please explain like I'm five.  To appeal to local sensibilities .  Rolls Royce 's Silver Shadow was originally going to be called Silver Mist , until they realised that ' Mist ' in German meant manure , rubbish or dirt .
