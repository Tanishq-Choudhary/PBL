Why do humans have different colored eyes ?  The color of your eyes is determined by your genes, which are the instructions that you inherit from your parents that tell your body how to grow and function.  There are many different shades of eye color, ranging from dark brown to light blue, and the most common eye colors are brown, blue, and green.  Please explain like I'm five.  What causes / caused people to have different colors of eyes ?  Is there a point to the color of your eyes other than superstitions ?  The combination of these pigments, along with the structure of the iris, determines the color of your eyes.  However, many people believe that the color of your eyes can reveal certain things about your personality or your health, but these beliefs are not supported by scientific evidence.  The iris contains two types of pigment: one called melanin, which gives your skin, hair, and eyes their color, and another called lipochrome, which is a yellowish pigment.  There is no scientific evidence to suggest that the color of your eyes has any special meaning or significance.  The color of your eyes is determined by the amount and type of pigments in your iris, which is the colored part of your eye, and by the way that the iris scatters light.  In short, the color of your eyes is simply a result of the combination of pigments and the way that light is scattered by your iris, and it has no special meaning or significance.
