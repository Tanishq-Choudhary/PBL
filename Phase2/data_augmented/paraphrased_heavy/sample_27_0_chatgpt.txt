How come we can land probes on comets and send satellites around the galaxy , but we ca n't put a high resolution color camera on these devices ?  Finally, it can also be expensive to design and build high resolution color cameras that are specifically designed for use in space.  There are also many other scientific instruments and sensors that are needed on these probes and satellites, so there may not be enough room or resources to include a high resolution color camera.  Please explain like I'm five.  One reason is that these devices often need to be small and lightweight in order to be launched into space.  Another reason is that the cameras need to be able to withstand the harsh conditions of space, including extreme temperatures, radiation, and micrometeoroid impacts.  Adding a high resolution color camera would add extra weight and complexity to the design, which could construct it more difficult and expensive to launch.  Just saw the Comet pictures and it made me wonder .  These conditions can be tough on electronic devices, so the cameras need to be robust and reliable in order to function properly.  There are a few reasons why we might not have high resolution color cameras on some space probes and satellites.  I hope this helps to explain why we might not have high resolution color cameras on some space probes and satellites.
