What is the purpose of a rubber chicken ?  Please explain like I'm five.  In elementary school we played a " game " where the teacher tossed his giant chicken down the field and us students on either side had to hit it mid - air with our smaller chickens .  Why do they exist ?  I assume this is the destiny of all rubber chickens .
