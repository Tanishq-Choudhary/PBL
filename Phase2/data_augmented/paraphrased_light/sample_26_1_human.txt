Pro - Union vs. Anti - Union arguments . Why is there so much controversy in America surrounding support or opposition of unions ? Please explain like I'm five. What I know of my company is that I make much more money than my unionized counterparts at other company locations and my benefits are far superior . We produce a larger quantity and higher quality product as well because we do n't have senseless union red tape that allows us to perform our jobs efficiently . For instance if my line is down because of an electric motor and there are 4 bolts that mount it to the floor . I can do whatever it takes to compete the task . In a union shop I would have to wait for an available mechanic to remove any bolts or fasteners so that I could remove the wires . If I were to do it myself to get it back running and make the company more profitable I would be fined or fired for taking work from another worker 's " craft " and violating the union contract .
