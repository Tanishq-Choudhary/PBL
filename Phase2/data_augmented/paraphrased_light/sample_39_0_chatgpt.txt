how is filibustering even a thing ? Why is filibustering even considered a valid tactic in politics ? Why is it simply not dismissed and does it have any practical uses ? Please explain like I'm five. Filibustering is a tactic used by politicians in some countries, including the United States, to try to block or delay a vote on a bill or proposal. It's called filibustering because it can involve a politician giving a very long speech or talking for a long time in order to delay the vote. Filibustering is considered a valid tactic in politics because it allows politicians to have a say in the decision-making process and to express their views and concerns. It can also be used as a way to force a compromise or a change in the proposal being considered. However, filibuster can also be used as a way to block or delay important decisions or progress on important issues. Some people argue that filibuster should be reformed or limited in order to allow the government to function more efficiently and to make sure that crucial issues are not held up for too long. Overall, filibuster can be a useful tactic for ensuring that all voices are heard and for allowing for discussion and debate, but it can also be abused and used to obstruct the work of the government.
