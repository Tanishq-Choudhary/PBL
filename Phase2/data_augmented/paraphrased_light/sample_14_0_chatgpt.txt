How does DRM work ? Digital Rights Management . The wikipedia page goes off in many directions . First hit my radar with the Xbox One stuff . How does DRM work and why is it so controversial ? Thank you ! Please explain like I'm five. Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a technology that is used to protect and control access to digital content, such as music, movies, ebooks, and software. It is often used by media companies, content creators, and publishers to prevent unauthorized copying and distribution of their content. There are many different ways that DRM can be implemented, but generally it works by encrypting the content and requiring users to authenticate themselves before they can access it. For example, if you want to play a song that has DRM on it, you may need to enter a special code or password in order to unlock it. DRM can be controversial because it can form it more difficult for people to use the content that they have purchased in the way that they want to. For example, if you buy a song from a store and it has DRM on it, you may not be able to play it on all of your devices, or you may have to jump through some hoops to get it to work. This can be frustrating for users, especially if they feel like they are paying for something that they can't fully use. There are also concerns about DRM being used to track users or limit their freedom to implement the content in certain ways. Some people believe that DRM is unnecessary and that it does more harm than good, while others argue that it is necessary to protect the rights of content creators and prevent piracy.
