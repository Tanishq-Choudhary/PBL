Why we experience the sensation of falling in our dreams / when we wake up Title basically says it all . What causes this sensation ? Why is it so seemingly universal and why is it so vivid relative to other physical sensations we experience in our dreams ? Please explain like I'm five. When you 're in between deep sleep and the lighter sleep where it 's easy to wake up , the sleep paralysis that stops you from acting out your dreams can do strange shit . Sometimes you 'll be surfacing to wakefulness again when your brain accidently throws the sleep paralysis switch again . The sudden tension in the body can feel like falling to a sleep - frazzled mind , and it galvanizes you strongly it can even create the sensation you 'd dropped onto the bed and bounced . You did n't . Your body just got switched into safe mode by accident .
