Why do we still have SD TV channels when HD looks like SD on an old TV ? Could n't we just have the HD version of the channels & delete the SD ones ? Please explain like I'm five. The way it works is that old TV stations got a certain amount of bandwidth to replace their old analog TV stations . Nonetheless , HD takes up more bandwidth then SD - so the stations can choose between 2 or 3 HD stations , or like 7 or 8 SD stations ( or a mix of both ) They can do a bunch of SD stations and make more money in advertizing by running 7 or 8 different reruns of old SD TV shows at a time In fact , those stations often got permanent rights to show an unlimited number of reruns of old syndicated shows in perpetuity . That means they do n't even have to pay anyone to air old eppisodes of _ Star Trek _ or _ Alf _ So basically it 's free money for them , based on being around for a long , long time and having their old rights get upgraded as new technology comes out .
