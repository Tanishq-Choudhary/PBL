Where do movies find newborn babies ? I have always thought that maybe they are just fake or some lady really let them employ her newborn Please explain like I'm five. Movies and TV shows often employ newborn babies as actors for scenes that require a baby to be shown on screen. These babies are usually provided by baby casting agencies, which are companies that specialize in finding and hiring babies and young children for roles in the entertainment industry. The babies used in movies and TV shows are typically a few weeks or months old, and they are usually accompanied by a parent or guardian on set. The babies are carefully supervised by the production team and are only used for short periods of time to ensure their safety and well-being. In some cases, filmmakers may use props or special effects to create the appearance of a newborn baby on screen, rather than using a real baby. This can be done using dolls, animatronics, or computer-generated imagery (CGI). Nonetheless, it is often more realistic to apply real babies when they are needed in a scene.
