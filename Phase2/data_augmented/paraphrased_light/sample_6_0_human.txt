Why I can not fabricate a religion that prevents me from going to school , then cite my first amendment rights when I am charged ? Prevents me from going to school by having , for example , supposed prayer times that coincide with school hours . Thanks ! Please explain like I'm five. Because you 're a minor and your parents get to construct that choice for you . Specifically to keep you from doing dumb shit like this . Now go to bed , you are going to school tomorrow .
