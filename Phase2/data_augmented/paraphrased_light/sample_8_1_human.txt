magic the gathering What is it . how popular is it . who plays it . The culture behind it .. etc . etc I have been hearing more and more about it , and after last nights South Park episode I became curious what it is .. Please explain like I'm five. Magic was invented , I want to say around 1994 , and was the first playable trading card game of its kind . Its format inspired more mainstream games , like Pokemon and Yugioh . I personally have known players as young as 8 or 9 , and as old as people in their 30 's and 40 's . Basically , the premise is that you 're a wizard fighting other wizards using magic spells . These spells are powered by a type of energy called mana , which is typically drawn from land . These spells can be used to summon creatures to fight for you , to help you and your creatures , or to harm your opponent and his creatures . Each player starts with 20 life points , and typically loses when they are reduced to 0 life points . There are five colors of mana , which represent the fundamental themes of the game . White represents order and justice , green represents nature and strength , red represents war and chaos , black represents death and self destruction , blue represents illusion and deception .
