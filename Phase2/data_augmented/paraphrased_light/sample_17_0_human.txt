What will happen to the United States economy as our debt increases and we continue to ignore it ? Will we eventually have to pay it off ? What if we do n't ? Please explain like I'm five. > Will we eventually have to pay it off ? What if we do n't ? Sorta , this " debt " is not the same as household debt . There are a handful of amazing ELI5s to help explain that part . ... Right now , economists do n't percieve the debt as much of an issue , we do n't understand how much is " too much debt " but what is going on right now , they generally agree is the right move . Currently , for the US to take out debt , its incredibly cheap , so cheap that its overwhelmingly in the US 's best benefit to keep taking out debt . --eventually this wo n't be the case , but no one is really sure when that will be .
