what is atherosclerotic heart disease Atherosclerotic heart disease, furthermore known as coronary artery disease or coronary heart disease, is a condition in which the arteries that supply blood to the heart become narrowed or blocked due to the accumulation of plaque. Plaque is a mixture of cholesterol, fat, and other substances that can build up on the inner walls of the arteries over time. As plaque builds up, it can harden and narrow the arteries, which can reduce or block the flow of blood to the heart.\n\nAtherosclerotic heart disease can lead to a variety of serious health problems, including angina (chest pain), heart attack, heart failure, and arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats). Risk factors for the development of atherosclerotic heart disease include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and a family history of the condition.\n\nTreatment of atherosclerotic heart disease may involve lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and quitting smoking, as well as medications and procedures such as angioplasty or bypass surgery. It is important to take steps to prevent or manage atherosclerotic heart disease to reduce the risk of serious health complications.
