why are stormclouds gray when normal clouds are white ? Should nt it just be water particles in both cases ? Please explain like I'm five. Yes , but the reason why it is darker is due to there being larger sized particles in the clouds . As they are getting closer to what we know as rain . This absorbs light differently light differently , thus making the cloud appear darker .
