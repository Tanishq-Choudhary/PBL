why are stormclouds gray when normal clouds are white ? Should nt it just be water particles in both cases ? Please explain like I'm five. It is just water particles , but stormclouds are thicker , and they completely block out the sun . When it 's raining and you look up , you 're not seeing the clouds , you 're seeing the shadow of the clouds .
