How does Amazon receive their items shipped to your house so quickly , no matter what it is ? Do they have big factories in every state carrying every possible item they sell ? Please explain like I'm five. Amazon fills up their distribution centers with popular items that are quickly sold . When you order something through Amazon from some store that you 've never heard of on the far side of the country , Amazon picks up an identical copy ( if they have one in stock ) from the closest distribution center to where you live and ship it out nearly immediately . The one from the store replaces the one in the distribution center . This is why sometimes a description will make a used item sound in poor shape , but when you get it , it 's better than you expected . This is how you can obtain popular or common items easily , but if you order something really weird or off the wall , it has to actually come from that store , through Amazon and then to your house and takes a lot longer . I used to work in a distribution center .
