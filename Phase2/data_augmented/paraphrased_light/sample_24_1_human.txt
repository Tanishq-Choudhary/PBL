How can AMD lose money year after year , yet still be in business ? AMD claims to lose money almost every quarter , and basically every single year . Here 's another quarter , and another loss : URL_0 how are they still in business ? Please explain like I'm five. " Losing money " when you 're a company with five billion dollars of income has a various meaning than it does for you and me . For example , they purchased ATI a few years ago . Because the way the accountants keep track of that stuff , that 's a $ 200 M " loss " on their financial statement . They take similar " losses " for producing new CPUs that they have n't sold yet & other things . That same you linked shows that , by a different way of accounting things , they * made * a tiny profit last quarter . As for how they keep going , they have a big fucking pile of money & other assets they 're sitting on . They can afford to lose a little money , year over year , because their long - term plan is to make money . ---- If you want to see how these numbers can be misleading , Amazon had been losing money every year from its founding until last year because they were spending shitloads of money expanding their infrastructure , advertising & building new business lines .
