What happens to the weapons and gear of fallen soldiers ? From my inferences in modern conflict you ca n't just leave AK 's in a foreign country because civilians can acquire them . Please explain to to me what happens to all this excess military equipment . Please explain like I'm five. The US military makes a reasonable effort to recover bodies and recover or destroy abandoned equipment . The firearm of a single soldier is n't a high priority item ( what 's an assault rifle in a nation filled with them ? ) but vehicles and heavy equipment may be bombed to avoid capture .
