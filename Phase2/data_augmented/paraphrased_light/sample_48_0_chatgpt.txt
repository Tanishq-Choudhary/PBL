Why have gas prices gone down ? Why have gas prices in the last few months plummeted and continue to do so ? Please explain like I'm five. There are a few reasons why gas prices have gone down in the past few months. One reason is that there is currently a lot of oil being produced around the world. Oil is used to make gasoline, so when there is a lot of oil available, it can help to lower the price of gasoline. Another reason is that people are using less gasoline due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people are staying at home and not driving as much, which means there is less demand for gasoline. When there is less demand for a product, the price of that product tends to go down. Finally, some countries produce and export a lot of oil, and the price of oil is often influenced by the relationships between these countries and how they trade with each other. If there is a lot of oil being produced and exported by certain countries, it can help to lower the price of gasoline. So, in summary, gas prices have gone down because there is currently a lot of oil being produced, people are using less gasoline due to the pandemic, and the relationships between oil-producing countries can also affect the price.
