What does LSD do ? Seeing as though its in the news about it and weed being the same . Please explain like I'm five. It does great things . But seriously , it latches onto a specific serotonin receptor subtype ( 5 - HT2A ) and activates it . I do n't think the process is fully understood , but this inhibits activity in the part of the brain associated with logic and the ego ; not ego in the sense of self - esteem , but ego in the sense of recognizing oneself as a separate entity from one 's surroundings . It additionally increases activity in the part of the brain associated with emotion and creativity .
