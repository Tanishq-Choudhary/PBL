Why does mixing lights result in a different color than mixing paint ? for example green + red = yellow in lights , and brown in paint . why does this happened . Please explain like I'm five. Mixing separate colors of light actually does result in a separate color, just like mixing paint does. The difference is in how our eyes and brains interpret the colors. When you mix two colors of paint together, the pigments in the paint absorb certain wavelengths of light and reflect others. For example, red paint reflects red light and absorbs other colors. When you mix red and green paint together, the resulting color is a brownish color because the pigments in the paint are absorbing all of the colors of light except for brown. On the other hand, when you mix two colors of light together, like red and green, the resulting color is a bright yellow since the light is actually adding together. This is since light is made up of various wavelengths of energy, and when you mix two colors of light together, you are adding the wavelengths of energy together. So, the reason why mixing paint results in a different color than mixing light is because paint absorbs certain wavelengths of light, while light adds different wavelengths of energy together.
