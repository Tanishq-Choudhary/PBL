How come we can land probes on comets and send satellites around the galaxy , but we ca n't put a high resolution color camera on these devices ? Just saw the Comet pictures and it made me wonder . Please explain like I'm five. We could now . But this probe was launched 10 years ago , and was designed and built mostly during the 90s .
