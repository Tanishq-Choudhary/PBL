what does karma mean in buddhism In Buddhism, karma refers to the law of cause and effect. According to this law, every action, whether physical or mental, produces a certain effect. This effect may be experienced immediately, or it may manifest at a later time.\n\nIn Buddhist teachings, the concept of karma is closely connected to the idea of reincarnation, the belief that after we die, our consciousness is reborn into another body. It is believed that the effects of our actions in this life will determine the circumstances of our next life. Good deeds, or virtuous actions, will lead to positive effects and better circumstances in the next life, while negative deeds, or non-virtuous actions, will lead to negative effects and worse circumstances.\n\nIn Buddhism, the goal is to ultimately break the cycle of reincarnation and achieve enlightenment, which is believed to be a state of ultimate freedom and understanding. This can be achieved through spiritual practice and the cultivation of positive karma.
