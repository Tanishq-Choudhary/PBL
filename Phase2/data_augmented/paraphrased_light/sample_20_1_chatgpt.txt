where is testosterone produced Testosterone is a hormone that is produced mainly in the testicles in men and the ovaries in women, although small amounts are also produced by the adrenal glands in both sexes. In men, testosterone is produced by cells in the testicles called Leydig cells. Testosterone is an important hormone that plays a role in many of the physical and behavioral characteristics that are considered typical of men, including muscle mass, body hair, and a deep voice. It is also important for maintaining bone density, sperm production, and sex drive. Testosterone levels tend to decline with age, and low testosterone levels can cause a range of symptoms, including decreased sex drive, decreased muscle mass and strength, and reduced bone density.
