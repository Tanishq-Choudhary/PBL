Is it true that glands in the breast that have produced milk can not get cancer ? How so ? My professor told the class this tidbit . Never heard it before . Please explain like I'm five. Your professor may be testing to observe if you 'll actually call them on their shit . Either that , or they 're full of shit . I say you should thoroughly research the topic and call BS . Either they will be impressed and congratulate you or be pissed and reveal just what sort of asshole they are .
