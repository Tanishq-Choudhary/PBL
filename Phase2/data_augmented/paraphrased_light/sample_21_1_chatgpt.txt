what does life insurance cover? Life insurance is a type of insurance that pays a financial benefit to the policyholder's designated beneficiary or beneficiaries upon the policyholder's death. The purpose of life insurance is to provide financial protection and peace of mind to the policyholder and their loved ones by covering the financial consequences of the policyholder's death.\n\nThere are two main types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.\n\nTerm life insurance provides coverage for a specific period of time, typically 10, 20, or 30 years. If the policyholder dies during the term of the policy, the insurer pays the death benefit to the beneficiary. If the policyholder does not die during the term of the policy, the policy expires and the coverage ends.\n\nPermanent life insurance, also known as whole life insurance, provides coverage for the entire lifetime of the policyholder. In addition to providing a death benefit, permanent life insurance also includes a savings component, which allows the policyholder to build cash value over time. This cash value can be used to help pay premiums or can be borrowed against or withdrawn.\n\nLife insurance can be used to help cover a variety of expenses, including funeral and burial costs, outstanding debts and mortgages, and ongoing living expenses for the policyholder's dependents. It can also be used to help fund future expenses, such as children's education or retirement.
