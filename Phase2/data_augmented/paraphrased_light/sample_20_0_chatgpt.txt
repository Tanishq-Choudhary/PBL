Why do assassins in movies / games always hold their knives with the blade facing down and not up ? [ like this ] ( URL_0 ) Please explain like I'm five. Holding a knife with the blade facing down is generally a more stable and secure grip, especially when the knife is being used for thrusting or stabbing motions. When the blade is facing up, it is more likely to slip out of the hand or be deflected by an opponent. In addition, holding a knife with the blade facing down allows the user to have better control over the blade and to apply more force when making a strike. Imagine that you are holding an apple in your hand and you want to cut it in half with a knife. If you hold the knife with the blade facing up, it might be more difficult to control the blade and keep it from slipping as you make the cut. On the other hand, if you hold the knife with the blade facing down, it will be easier to keep the blade steady and apply more force as you cut through the apple. In movies and games, assassins and other characters who employ knives may hold them with the blade facing down for these same reasons. It allows them to have better control over the weapon and to construct more precise and powerful strikes.
