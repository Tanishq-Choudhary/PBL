how is rfid tag powered RFID tags are powered by a small coil of wire that is embedded in the tag. This coil is connected to a small capacitor, which stores a small amount of electrical charge. When the RFID tag is brought near an RFID reader, the reader sends out a radio frequency (RF) signal that activates the coil in the tag, causing it to create an electromagnetic field. This field powers the tag and allows it to transmit its stored data back to the reader.\n\nThere are two main types of RFID tags: active tags and passive tags. Active tags have their own power source, such as a battery, and can transmit their data over longer distances than passive tags. Passive tags, on the other hand, do not have their own power source and rely on the electromagnetic field created by the reader to power and activate them.\n\nRFID tags are used in a variety of applications, including supply chain management, inventory tracking, and access control. They are often minute and can be embedded in a variety of materials, including paper, plastic, and metal.
