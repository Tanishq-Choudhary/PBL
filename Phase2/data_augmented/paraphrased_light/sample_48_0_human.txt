Why have gas prices gone down ? Why have gas prices in the last few months plummeted and continue to do so ? Please explain like I'm five. It 's because the price of oil is dropping . URL_0 It went from a high of around $ 100 per barrel in July down to about $ 78 now , so that 's more than 20 % cheaper . The cost of gasoline at the pump is the price of oil , plus the cost to ship , refine , market , sell , and taxes . But the price of oil is the most variable one . Why is the price of oil going down ? Hard to say , but Saudi Arabia is pumping a lot more than usual and has n't slowed down to keep prices up . Also , the US and Canada have started producing a lot more oil thanks to a fresh technology called fracking . Ignore the guy that said its election politics -- even the US is n't enormous enough to move global oil prices down that much for that long .
