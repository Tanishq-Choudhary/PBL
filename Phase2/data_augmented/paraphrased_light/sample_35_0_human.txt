How can someone spend $ 40,000 trying to develop a recent alphabet letter to replace the word " The " ? URL_0 Please explain like I'm five. * So , was that as good for you as it was for me ? Mathis has apparently spent nearly $ 40,000 developing the symbol and advocating its inclusion as the 27th letter of the alphabet . * Meaning that that $ 40,000 has n't just gone into the development of the symbol , which most likely cost only a fraction of the money , but moreover into trying to convince people to use it , probably travelling around to attend linguistic conferences etc etc .
