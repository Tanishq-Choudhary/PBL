Pro - Union vs. Anti - Union arguments . Why is there so much controversy in America surrounding support or opposition of unions ? Please explain like I'm five. It 's largely politics . Unions tend to be very strong supporters of the Democratic party , and that does n't sit well with Republicans . But , for some specific points of contention : * Unions fight for what they suppose is a fair wage . Some people think that wage is unreasonably high . * Unions support closed shop laws , which make it illegal to hold certain jobs if you 're not in a union . Others support right to work laws , because they do n't think union membership should be mandatory . * In theory , unions work for better conditions for workers . However , some unions are corrupt , linked to organized crime , and hold nonunion workers in contempt .
