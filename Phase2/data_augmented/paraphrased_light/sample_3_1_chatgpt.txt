how does a dredge work? A dredge is a machine that is used to excavate and pump sediments, such as sand, mud, and gravel, from the bottom of bodies of water. Dredges can be used for a variety of purposes, including maintaining navigable waterways, reclaiming land, and extracting minerals and other resources from the seabed.\n\nThere are several different types of dredges, but most work by using a bucket or a suction device to lift the sediment from the bottom of the water and then transport it to a different location. Some dredges utilize a bucket-wheel system, which consists of a series of buckets mounted on a rotating wheel that scoop up the sediment as the wheel turns. Other dredges implement a suction pipe, which sucks up the sediment through a nozzle at the end of the pipe and transports it through a hose to a barge or other vessel.\n\nDredges are typically operated by a crew of skilled workers who control the various systems and equipment on the dredge. The dredge itself is often mounted on a barge or other vessel, which allows it to move from one location to another as needed.\n\nOverall, the basic process of dredging involves using the dredge to excavate and remove sediment from the bottom of a body of water, and then transport it to a different location for disposal or processing.
