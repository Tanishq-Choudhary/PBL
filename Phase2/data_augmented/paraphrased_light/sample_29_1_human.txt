How vulnerable are TOR users . I 'm not literally 5 , and I have a basic knowledge of computers , but I simply ca n't understand [ this ] ( URL_0 ) . How can an attacker deanonymize a victim using this procedure ? Please explain like I'm five. Let me start with this I'M NOT A LAWYER OR AN IT PROFESSIONAL Now that we got that out of the way . I 'll explain to you my understanding ( which could be very wrong ) There have been rumors that the FBI , DEA , and NSA have some part in TOR , and as such it is compromised , and is no safer then the regular web . I have n't seen evidence to confirm that however that does n't mean it 's not true . With that being said from my understanding it 's commonly accepted that TOR alone is n't safe enough . You have to follow to a T their instructions to make sure you are running things exactly as they say ie no flash , etc . In addition to that most people recommend using VPN . Using Starbucks internet rather than you 're home connection could n't hurt also . From what I understand just browsing the deep web is n't illegal .... viewing illegal materials / purchasing illegal materials is a whole other story . Use bitcoin only .... use escrow . Use Escrow . USE ESCROW ! ! ! ! ! Once said package arrives ( Do n't use your name . Any decent vendor will know this also ) When the box comes bring it in but do n't open it . Not for at least 3 business days . Anyone comes snooping around asking about a suspicious package .... AGREE that you got a suspicious package , and were n't sure what to do with it ... you never requested it . It just showed up . If after 3 or 4 BUSINESS days have passed , and no postman / postmaster / cop / fed has showed up ... you should be ok . Also .... DON'T PERFORM ILLEGAL ACTIONS . THEY ARE ILLEGAL .
