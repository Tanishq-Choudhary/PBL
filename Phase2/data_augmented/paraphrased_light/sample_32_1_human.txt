Why does mixing lights result in a various color than mixing paint ? for example green + red = yellow in lights , and brown in paint . why does this happened . Please explain like I'm five. Sources of light use what 's called an additive color model . Each source adds new wavelengths , thus the collective light is the sum of all sources . Thus when you have a red and green light , your eyes are receiving both red and green bands of light . Paints and pigments implement a subtractive color model . In this case , the material absorbs some wavelengths and reflects others . No new wavelengths are added . Thus mixing colored paints , it will absorb more colors , causing fewer wavelengths to be reflected back . If mathematically inclined , think of additive sources as a union and substractive pigments as an intersect .
