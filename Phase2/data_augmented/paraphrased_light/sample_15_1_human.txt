Why are we forced to use banks to receive our income ? Obv not including illegal / off the books cash in hand work and that sort of thing .. Edit : It 's a pity people inside america are so stupid . Please explain like I'm five. It 's much easier for an employer to keep all of it 's money in their bank than to go withdraw whatever they owe you and hand it to you every two weeks . If you employ direct deposit , it 's a lot easier for you too .
