How does depression work in the brain ? And is it more physical of psychological ? ( Both cause and symptoms ) Please explain like I'm five. As someone who suffers from severe depression I can tell you mine is both physical and psychological . I know in my heart that no matter what circumstances I could ever be subjected to would never change that or get rid of it , it would be more of a genetics thing I suppose . Lately I tried to explain it to a friend and the only thing I can really use as an analogy for me are paper towels . Some are produced cheap and are shit , they tear and do n't soak up shit . These paper towels are still trying to be good but poor genes have them already behind a better crafted towel . Now let 's pretend we have two hammocks with one being designed using the shitty paper towel and one using the really strong and absorbent towel . If you consider each one of life 's problems and also just poor genes as a marble and you were to drop a marble into the hammocks they would eventually fall thru and you would be screwed . I view talking and medicine as a removal of a marble or two and at the end of the day I suppose each person develops ways of removing marbles but the marbles do n't stop coming . This whole life is just a flimsy , soaked towel and I lost my marbles .
