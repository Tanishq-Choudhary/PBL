what is the cabin pressure of us airlines The cabin pressure of most commercial airliners in the United States is maintained at an altitude equivalent of between 6,000 and 8,000 feet above sea level. This is done to ensure the comfort and safety of passengers and crew. At this altitude, the air is thin enough to provide adequate oxygen to the body, but not so thin that it becomes difficult to breathe. The cabin pressure is regulated by the aircraft's pressurization system, which pumps air into the cabin from the engines and maintains a consistent pressure throughout the flight. It is important to note that the actual cabin pressure may vary slightly depending on the specific aircraft and the altitude at which it is flying.
