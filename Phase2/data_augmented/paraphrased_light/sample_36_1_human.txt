The differences between flash and HTML5 Which one is better for me as a user ? Please explain like I'm five. Essentially Flash is a product , whereas HTML5 is an open standard agreed upon by the internet 's " governing body " . Flash is a separate program that is run embedded within the browser , whereas HTML5 is a new version of the HTML markup language used to lay out web pages that is simply rendered by the browser natively . HTML5 is a W3C standard ( it is defined by the World - Wide - Web Committee , a group that defines common standards for Internet protocols and technologies ) whereas Flash is a proprietary product , owned by Adobe . IMO ( as a Solution Architect - a person who designs large scale software systems ) and former software engineer and web developer HTML5 is far superior . The open standard thing is critical as it means that all vendors * should * implement the way they render it in the same way as opposed to Flash which requires you to download and keep updated an extra program as well as your browser . HTML5 is highly capable in terms of animation and etc which * used to * require Flash ( or Microsoft Silverlight , a similar product ) and performs better in every case I have seen , although as it has only just been ratified as a standard I have n't yet seen any HTML5 games , for example . I 'm sure they 're out there though !
