Why can does bark what seems like forever but people can only scream for a hour or two ? I mean some dogs wo n't shut up and constantly yap . Please explain like I'm five. Dogs bark for a variety of reasons, such as to alert their owners of something, to communicate with other dogs, or to express excitement or frustration. Some dogs are more prone to barking than others, and some breeds are known for being more vocal than others. People can only scream for a short period of time because our bodies are not built to handle the strain of screaming for long periods of time. Screaming uses a lot of energy and can be very tiring, which is why people can only do it for a short period of time before they need to rest. Dogs, on the other hand, are built differently and are able to bark for longer periods of time without getting as tired. Dogs also have distinct vocal cords than humans, which may make it easier for them to bark for longer periods of time without damaging their vocal cords.
