what forms seasons Seasons are caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis as it orbits the sun. The Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of about 23.5 degrees relative to its orbit around the sun. This tilt causes the amount of solar energy that reaches the Earth's surface to vary over the course of the year.\n\nDuring the summer months, the North Pole is tilted towards the sun, so the Northern Hemisphere receives more direct sunlight and has longer days. This leads to warmer temperatures and the summer season.\n\nDuring the winter months, the North Pole is tilted away from the sun, so the Northern Hemisphere receives less direct sunlight and has shorter days. This leads to cooler temperatures and the winter season.\n\nThe same process occurs in the Southern Hemisphere, but with the seasons reversed. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.\n\nSeasons also vary in length depending on the location on the Earth. For example, areas closer to the equator experience less dramatic changes in the amount of sunlight they receive throughout the year, so they tend to have less pronounced seasons.
