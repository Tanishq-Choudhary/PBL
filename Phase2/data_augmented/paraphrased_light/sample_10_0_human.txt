What is a hacker really doing ? I 've always wanted to know why hackers are jamming on their keyboards and what they can possibly be doing that requires such precision and speed .

This is done in movies to make it look dramatic and exciting . Real computer hacking involves staring at a computer screen for hours of a time , searching a lot on Google , muttering " hmmm " and various expletives to oneself now and then , and stroking one 's hacker - beard while occasionally tapping on a few keys .
