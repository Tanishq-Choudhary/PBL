How does DRM work ? Digital Rights Management . The wikipedia page goes off in many directions . Initial hit my radar with the Xbox One stuff . How does DRM work and why is it so controversial ? Thank you ! Please explain like I'm five. DRM is restricting the ways you can utilize the product you purchased to make it harder for pirates to implement . Some examples are having a CD key before you can use your software , or putting an empty ring on the edge of a CD so that a computer thinks it 's empty , while a CD player is too dumb to care and keeps reading it anyway , or having a code on MP3 files that prevents them from being played unless another hidden authorization file is on the computer , or requiring you to sign into a remote server before you can play your game ( most EA titles , Diablo III )
