What is a hacker really doing ? I 've always wanted to know why hackers are jamming on their keyboards and what they can possibly be doing that requires such precision and speed . Please explain like I'm five. Computers are stupid , they do n't know what they are doing , they just do it . If you tell a computer to give a cake to every person that walks through the door , it will do . Hackers are the people that get extra cake by going around the building and back through the door . GLaDOS however , will give you no cake .
