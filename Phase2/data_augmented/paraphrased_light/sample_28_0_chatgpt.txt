It is not true that glands in the breast that have produced milk cannot get cancer. Any part of the body, including the breasts, can potentially develop cancer. The breast is made up of various types of cells, including glandular cells, which produce milk, and connective tissue cells. Cancer can develop in either of these types of cells, as well as in other cells in the breast. The most common type of breast cancer is ductal carcinoma, which starts in the cells lining the milk ducts. It is important for all individuals to be aware of the signs and symptoms of breast cancer and to practice regular self-exams and seek medical care if they notice any changes in their breasts. It is additionally important to acquire regular mammograms and other screenings, as recommended by a healthcare provider, in order to detect breast cancer early and increase the chances of successful treatment.
