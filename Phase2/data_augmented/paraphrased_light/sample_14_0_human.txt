How does DRM work ? Digital Rights Management . The wikipedia page goes off in many directions . Foremost hit my radar with the Xbox One stuff . How does DRM work and why is it so controversial ? Thank you ! Please explain like I'm five. The reason wikipedia goes off in many directions is because it 's a generic term , it does n't describe any single technique . It 's just attempting to get people to pay you for their thing , preventing them from pirating it . It 's controversial because a lot of DRM implementations tend to be extremely inconvenient for the legit customers , whereas the people that would pirate your product will likely be able to do it anyway , and because their copy is cracked , they do n't see the downside of the restrictive DRM . It literally only hurts the paying customers , which in turn forces more people to pirate . Nobody wins .
