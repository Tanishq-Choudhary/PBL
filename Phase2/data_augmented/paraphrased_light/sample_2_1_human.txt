Why do we still have SD TV channels when HD looks like SD on an old TV ? Could n't we just have the HD version of the channels & delete the SD ones ? Please explain like I'm five. HD does n't look like anything at all on an SD TV . An old SD television ca n't even process the HD signal . We still have SD channels because there are still SD televisions out there .
