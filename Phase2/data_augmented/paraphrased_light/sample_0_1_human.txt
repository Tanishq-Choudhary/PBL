Why is every book I hear about a " NY Times # 1 Best Seller " ? ELI5 : Why is every book I hear about a " NY Times # 1 Best Seller " ? Should n't there only be one " # 1 " best seller ? Please explain like I'm five. If you 're hearing about it , it 's due to it was a very good or very well - publicized book ( or both ) , and almost every good or well - publicized book will be # 1 on the NY Times bestseller list for at least a little bit . Kindof like how almost every big or nice movies are # 1 at the box office on their opening weekend .
