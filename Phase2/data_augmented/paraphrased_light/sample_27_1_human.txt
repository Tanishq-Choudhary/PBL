How come we can land probes on comets and send satellites around the galaxy , but we ca n't put a high resolution color camera on these devices ? Just saw the Comet pictures and it made me wonder . Please explain like I'm five. To put it simply , more megapixels = higher resolution = larger filesize = more 1s/0s . I 'm not sure about the data transfer rate between the probe and Earth , but I 'm assuming that it 's not a quick process . The lower resolution image probably took a little while to send , therefore a higher resolution image will take a significantly longer time to send .
