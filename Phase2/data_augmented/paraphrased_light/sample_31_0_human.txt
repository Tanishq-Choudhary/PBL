How did pirates / navy track down other ships back before radar / sonar ? I wondered this while watching Pirates of the Caribbean and wondered how ships chased each other down ? It 's not possible to track steps through ocean . Please explain like I'm five. they really did nt . But often you knew where ships were likely to be . There are only so many ports , and the bigger a ship the bigger a port it needs to be able to dock . A pirate might wait in the shipping lanes a day or two outside of a busy port and wait for a target . Or he might wait for a ship to dock and become a sitting target in an undefended port . A third choice is to cruise near nautical choke points like between islands or outside sandbars . Large convoys of vessels additionally usually took predictable routes , there was a range of a few degrees which offered the fastest trip to and from Europe due to trade winds and currents , and ships tried to avoid sailing in storm and hurricane season so there tended to be a fine deal of activity when it was optimal for sailing . Once a ship was in sight it was then just a matter of who was the better seaman , or which ship was to windward , and in many cases some luck . Ships might be in sight but 20 miles away and still be in a chase .
