What are prions and are they a big deal ? My AP Biology teacher mentioned them alongside viruses but he did n't say much else beyond that they are n't viruses and they deform protein structure . Please explain like I'm five. A prion is a special kind of deformed protein . When it comes in contact with normal proteins , it causes them to deform in the same way . So not only are the proteins deformed will no longer to their jobs , they spread the deformity to other proteins .
