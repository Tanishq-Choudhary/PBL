how is filibustering even a thing ? Why is filibustering even considered a valid tactic in politics ? Why is it simply not dismissed and does it have any practical uses ? Please explain like I'm five. Filibustering is a tactic that evolved in the Senate . It 's often called a " parliamentary procedure , " as it results not from constitutional law but the internal rules of the legislature . In order to allow time for a bill to be discussed and debated , a 60 vote majority is required to proceed from discussion to a vote . Senators realized they could exploit this rule to keep the majority from passing a bill , unless they had a 60 - vote majority ( a " Fillibuster - proof majority . " Filibusters used to require a significant investment of time . Senators grew weary of the pain of a filibuster , and today , the mere threat of a filibuster is enough to get a bill withdrawn due to the time involved ( [ Senators in the past were known to read recipes , Shakespeare , anything in sight ] ( URL_0 ) ) Now , to your questions : Why is it valid ? Because it works for the minority party . Why is it not simply dismissed ? No majority will eliminate it because they understand it will be useful to them in the future . You 'll hear of the " Nuclear Option " from time to time , a threat to eliminate the filibuster by changing the rules ( by simple majority ) . So far , it has not happened . I would n't be surprised to see it happen in the next congress - the rise of apply of filibuster is unprecedented ( the filibuster itself is less than 100 years old ) and scorched - earth politicking has become more and more common inside the beltway . Does it have any practical uses ? Yes : It 's a tool for the minority party to block particularly controversial legislation .
