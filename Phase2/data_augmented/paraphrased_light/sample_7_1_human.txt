What has changed that we frequently now throw away products instead of fixing them ? Is it the quality or nature of the products themselves , or more cultural in origin ? Please explain like I'm five. planned obsolescence is the term . You can engineer a product to be maintainable or you can engineer it to always be using parts that are a much higher cost to produce ( making you prefer replacing it ) . Disposable technology is cheaper to construct and more profitable for the company that makes it . URL_0 ( you 'll find my example in the Lifespan - Limiting Design section )
