How does Amazon get their items shipped to your house so quickly , no matter what it is ? Do they have big factories in every state carrying every possible item they sell ? Please explain like I'm five. Amazon has a very efficient system for getting items shipped to customers quickly. Here's how it works: 1. When you order something from Amazon, the company uses its computer systems to find the item you want in one of its various warehouses around the world. These warehouses are like giant stores where Amazon keeps all of the items it sells. 2. Once the computer finds the item, it tells a worker to pick it up and put it in a box. 3. The box is then sent to a sorting facility, where it is sorted and sent to a package delivery company like FedEx or UPS. 4. The delivery company then takes the box and brings it to your house. So, Amazon doesn't necessarily have large factories in every state, but it does have a network of warehouses around the world where it keeps a wide variety of items. When you order something from Amazon, the company is able to quickly find the item and get it shipped to you through this system.
