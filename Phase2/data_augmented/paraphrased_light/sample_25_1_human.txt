What did Harry Potter have that made it such a massively successful series ? In other words , what were the factors which lead to the unrivaled success of Harry Potter ? Please explain like I'm five. It 's honestly the same basic story that 's been told for centuries . A savior / chosen one arrives on the scene to save the world . Like other particularly successful spins on this basic story ( eg , Lord of the Rings , Star Wars , The Hunger Games ) , its success stems from Rowling 's ability to create a unique world and populate it with characters we can root for and against . I think what separates Rowling is that even though her story is in a very fantastical universe , it 's still relatable to all ages . We all attended primary school / middle school / high school , so it 's easy to recognize the awkward first kiss , the school bully and the teacher everyone hated . And who would n't want to attend Wizarding school at Hogwarts , play Quidditch , drink Butterbeer , and learn how to cast spells to thwart our enemies ? Middle school in particular is one of the more awkward , miserable times for most people and Rowling offered an alternate reality where school is actually fun , your best friends really are forever and you are empowered to actually change things .
