how are antibodies used in Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system to help protect the body against foreign substances, such as viruses, bacteria, and toxins. They are a key part of the immune system's response to these substances, known as antigens.\n\nThere are many ways in which antibodies are used in medicine and research. Some examples include:\n\nDiagnosis of diseases: Antibodies can be used to detect the presence of specific antigens in a sample of bodily fluid, such as blood or urine. This can help diagnose infections or autoimmune disorders.\n\nTreatment of diseases: Antibodies can be used to target and destroy specific antigens in the body. This can be used to treat diseases caused by the presence of these antigens, such as cancer or autoimmune disorders.\n\nResearch: Antibodies can be used to study the structure and function of proteins in the body. They can be used to purify specific proteins, or to identify and track the location of specific proteins within cells or tissues.\n\nDrug development: Antibodies can be used as therapeutic agents to treat diseases, either alone or in combination with other drugs.\n\nFood safety: Antibodies can be used to detect the presence of harmful substances, such as pathogens or toxins, in food. This can help ensure the safety of the food supply.
