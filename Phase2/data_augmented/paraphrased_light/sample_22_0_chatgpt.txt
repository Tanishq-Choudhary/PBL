Why the same products / brands have differents names in different countries ? for example : USA - Crest ; Europe - Blend - a - Med Feel free to give some more examples :) Please explain like I'm five. There are a few reasons why the same products or brands might have different names in distinct countries. One reason is that different countries often have different languages, and it can be easier for people to recognize and remember a brand name if it is written in their own language. For example, Crest is a brand of toothpaste that is popular in the United States, and Blend-a-Med is a brand of toothpaste that is popular in Europe. Both brands make toothpaste, but they have different names as they are marketed to people who speak different languages. Another reason why products might have different names in separate countries is because different countries have different regulations about what can be sold and how it can be marketed. For example, some countries have laws that require products to have certain types of labels or warning messages, or that prohibit certain types of advertising. In order to comply with these laws, companies might need to use different names for their products in separate countries. Finally, some companies simply choose to use different names for their products in different countries in order to appeal to different markets. For example, a company might use a more traditional or classic name for its products in one country, and a more modern or trendy name in another country, in order to better match the preferences of consumers in those markets.
