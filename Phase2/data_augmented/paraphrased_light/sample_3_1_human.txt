Why has nobody assassinated Kim Jong - un He is such a pest and nuisance to basically the entire world except for China . Why has n't anyone had him assassinated yet ? Please explain like I'm five. It would n't really do any good . It 's not like North Korea would instantly convert to freedom - loving democracy if he died .
