What has changed that we frequently now throw away products instead of fixing them ? Is it the quality or nature of the products themselves , or more cultural in origin ? Please explain like I'm five. There are a few different factors that can contribute to the trend of throwing away products instead of fixing them. One factor is the quality of the products themselves. Some products are designed in a way that makes them difficult or impossible to repair. For example, if a product is made with very cheap materials or is put together in a way that makes it hard to access the parts that need to be repaired, it may be easier or cheaper to just throw it away and buy a fresh one rather than try to fix it. Another factor is cultural in origin. In some societies, it is more common or acceptable to throw away things that are broken or no longer wanted, rather than trying to repair them or give them to someone else who might be able to use them. This can be influenced by things like the availability of cheap, new products and the convenience of being able to just buy a new item instead of trying to fix the old one. Finally, in some cases, the cost of repairing a product might be more expensive than buying a new one. This can happen if the product is very old or if the parts needed to fix it are hard to find or very expensive. In these cases, it might make more sense to just buy a novel product instead of trying to repair the old one.
