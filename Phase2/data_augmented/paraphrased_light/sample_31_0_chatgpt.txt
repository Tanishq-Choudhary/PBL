How did pirates / navy track down other ships back before radar / sonar ? I wondered this while watching Pirates of the Caribbean and wondered how ships chased each other down ? It 's not possible to track steps through ocean . Please explain like I'm five. Before radar and sonar were invented, pirates and navies used a variety of methods to track down other ships. One common method was to utilize visual clues, such as looking for the sails or smoke from the ship's chimney. They might furthermore use telescopes or other instruments to help them spot ships at a distance. Another method was to implement the stars and other celestial bodies as navigation aids. By looking at the position of the stars and other celestial objects, sailors could determine their own location and the direction they were heading. They could then use this information to figure out where other ships might be located. Sailors also used maps and charts to help them navigate the oceans. These could show them the locations of land masses, reefs, and other hazards, as well as the directions of the currents and winds. By using these tools, sailors could plan their routes and figure out the best way to reach their destination. Finally, sailors might utilize their own senses, such as hearing and smell, to help them locate other ships. For example, they might be able to hear the sound of another ship's anchor being dropped or the smell of wood smoke from its chimney. Overall, while tracking down other ships was difficult before the invention of modern technology, sailors were still able to apply a variety of tools and techniques to navigate the oceans and locate other ships.
