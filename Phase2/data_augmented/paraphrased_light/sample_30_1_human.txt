How come I have to pay for Foxtel and get ads , when things like youtube are free because they play ads . Should n't Foxtel be you pay and you do nt get ads , or it should be free and you obtain ads . Please explain like I'm five. If foxtel is a cable provider then the reason is that the networks themselves are the ones selling advertising time on their networks / channels , not the cable provider . The commercials largely ( ? ) pay for programs to be made . The cable provider pays for rights to broadcast the networks . The consumer pays the provider to view the networks . Edit : More importantly , you 're paying foxtel to maintain the infrastructure which allows them to broadcast to your home .
