Why is Monsanto considered to be such an evil company by so many people ? What have they done ? What are they currently doing ? Please explain like I'm five.

My family farms and I believe it stems from being associated with GMO 's and as for the suing farmers thing I have no idea how it got so blown out of proportion . First , by buying Monsanto 's seeds you agree to not use the seeds grown for another crop and they are allowed onto your field to check . If you do n't like it you can buy , a usually poorer yielding , type of seed . Second , if there is cross contamination from a field you are NOT sued , Monsanto pays for the clean - up and crop lost . Finally , you can look up the actual number of lawsuits its 145 since 1997 with only 11 going to court . You have to be blatantly saving the seeds and seeding them to be sued .
