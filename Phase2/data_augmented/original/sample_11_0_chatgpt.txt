How does depression work in the brain ? And is it more physical of psychological ? ( Both cause and symptoms ) Please explain like I'm five.

Depression is a medical condition that affects the way you feel. It can be caused by a combination of physical, psychological, and environmental factors. 
In the brain, depression is thought to be caused by an imbalance of certain chemicals called neurotransmitters. These chemicals help transmit messages between nerve cells in the brain. When there is an imbalance of neurotransmitters, it can affect your mood and behavior. 
Symptoms of depression can be both physical and psychological. Physical symptoms may include changes in appetite and sleep patterns, fatigue, and body aches. Psychological symptoms may include feeling sad or hopeless, losing interest in activities you used to enjoy, and difficulty concentrating. 
It's important to note that everyone experiences depression differently, and treatment may involve a combination of therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes. If you think you or someone you know may be experiencing depression, it's important to speak with a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation and treatment plan.
