Why the same products / brands have differents names in different countries ? for example : USA - Crest ; Europe - Blend - a - Med Feel free to give some more examples :) Please explain like I'm five.

To appeal to local sensibilities . Crest is actually sold as Crest in the UK , but Blend - a - Med was already an established toothpaste brand in parts of Europe , that Procter and Gamble acquired , and they used the name as it was familiar to their target market . In some cases , it might be that a name just does n't read well the way that native speakers of the local language might pronounce it . In other cases , it might be that the name means something undesirable . Rolls Royce 's Silver Shadow was originally going to be called Silver Mist , until they realised that ' Mist ' in German meant manure , rubbish or dirt .
