Why does my pizza box say preheat oven , when I can just put it in for a couple minutes longer and it 's the same thing ? It also says ( keep pizza frozen while preheating ) , what difference does that make ? Please explain like I'm five.

They are giving you a controlled experience . If your pizza is frozen until it gets into an oven already heated to a precise temperature , it will heat the same way every time . If your pizza thaws to room temperature first , they do nt know what your room temperature is or how long it 's out and how close it gets to room temperature , so they ca n't account for that . So they 'll never be able to give you exact times like they do . Same if you have a super powerful commercial oven vs a wimpy old one , or a huge cavernous oven vs one a pizza can barely fit in . They will take different amounts of time to heat up , cooking the pizzas different amounts . In addition , cooking for a long time at low temperatures actually has different effects on your ingredients than cooking fast at a high temperature , so you get a slightly different result , although with most pizzas it 's hard to notice .
