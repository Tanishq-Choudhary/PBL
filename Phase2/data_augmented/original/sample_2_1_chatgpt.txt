what are add ons

Add-ons are additional pieces of software that can be installed into a larger software application to extend its functionality. They can also be called extensions, plugins, or modules. They are usually developed by third-party developers and can be installed into the main application to add new features or capabilities.\n\nAdd-ons are commonly used in web browsers to enhance the user experience or add new features to the browser. For example, a browser add-on might allow you to block ads, translate web pages, or save passwords. Add-ons can also be used in other types of software, such as word processors or productivity tools, to add new features or functionality.\n\nIt's important to be careful when installing add-ons, as they can potentially pose security risks or cause compatibility issues with the main application. It's a good idea to only install add-ons from reputable sources and to be mindful of any permissions the add-on requests before installing it.
