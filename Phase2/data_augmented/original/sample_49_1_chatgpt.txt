What was "Freedom Summer"?

"Freedom Summer" was a campaign in the United States in the summer of 1964 to register as many African-American voters as possible in Mississippi, which at the time had a history of discrimination against black voters and was effectively a one-party state dominated by white Democrats. The campaign was organized by civil rights groups, including the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and was intended to challenge the discriminatory voting practices and segregationist policies in the South.\n\nDuring Freedom Summer, hundreds of volunteers, most of them young white students from the North, traveled to Mississippi to work on voter registration drives and other civil rights initiatives. They faced significant opposition and violence from white segregationists, including the Ku Klux Klan, and several volunteers were killed. Despite the dangers and challenges, the campaign was successful in increasing the number of registered black voters in Mississippi and helped to pave the way for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibited discrimination in voting on the basis of race.
