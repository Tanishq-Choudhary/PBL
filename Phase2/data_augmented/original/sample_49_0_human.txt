Why does the Double Jeopardy Clause exist ? Why are you not allowed to prosecute someone when they been pronounced not guilty , when new evidence has been found ? Please explain like I'm five.

It is to ensure that they ca n't be retried over and over in the same court until they finally give up and give a guilty / not guilty verdict . You can appeal and send it up the chain of command if new evidence comes to light and you think it would win you the case , but that 's a totally different courtroom .
