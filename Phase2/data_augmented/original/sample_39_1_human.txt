how is filibustering even a thing ? Why is filibustering even considered a valid tactic in politics ? Why is it simply not dismissed and does it have any practical uses ? Please explain like I'm five.

The point is to make sure that a tightly - knit majority does n't run roughshod over the minority . It is , by design , a stalling tactic to try and put the brakes on the discussion until the minority thinks there has been sufficient debate . Originally you had to actually filibuster -- that is , get up and talk ( the way that Rand Paul and Ted Cruz did fairly recently ) , but the Senate has expanded its use to allow Senators to just declare that they are filibustering . Ultimately the check on its use is in overuse -- if you use it too often , you and your party start to develop a bad name and lose even more seats . It actually was used in the House of Representatives until the mid-19th century , when it got way out of hand and the rules were changed .
