What is the significance of Good Friday?

Good Friday is a Christian holiday commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and his death at Calvary. It is observed during Holy Week, the week leading up to Easter Sunday.\n\nThe holiday is significant to Christians because it represents the moment when Jesus willingly sacrificed himself for the salvation of humanity. According to the Christian belief, Jesus's death on the cross and subsequent resurrection three days later made it possible for people to be reconciled with God and to have eternal life.\n\nGood Friday is marked by solemn and somber observances, including church services and devotions, fasting, and the performance of passion plays that depict the events leading up to and including Jesus's death. Many Christians also observe a day of mourning and reflection on Good Friday, remembering the suffering and death of Jesus and expressing their gratitude for the sacrifice he made.
