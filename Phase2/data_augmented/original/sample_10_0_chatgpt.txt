What is a hacker really doing ? I 've always wanted to know why hackers are jamming on their keyboards and what they can possibly be doing that requires such precision and speed . Please explain like I'm five.

A hacker is someone who uses their computer skills to try to gain access to systems or networks without permission. Hackers might do this for a variety of reasons, such as to steal information, to cause damage or disruption, or just for the challenge of it. 
Hacking can involve a lot of typing and computer use, because hackers often use special software and programs to try to find weaknesses in a system or network. They might also use tools to try to guess passwords or to find ways to get around security measures. This can involve a lot of trial and error, which is why hackers might seem to be "jamming on their keyboards" as they try different approaches. 
Overall, hacking can be a complex and technical activity that requires a lot of knowledge and skill. Hackers might use a wide range of techniques and tools to try to achieve their goals, and they might spend a lot of time researching and testing different approaches to find a way in.
