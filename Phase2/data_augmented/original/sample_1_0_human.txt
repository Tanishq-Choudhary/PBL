If salt is so bad for cars , why do we use it on the roads ? As the title states , why do we use it ? is there no other option or what ? Please explain like I'm five.

salt is good for not dying in car crashes and car crashes are worse for cars then salt . Some places use other things , but salt is really cheap compared to most alternatives , although sand is pretty good .
