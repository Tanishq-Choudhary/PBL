what is metformin used for

Metformin is a medication that is used to treat type 2 diabetes. It works by helping to lower the amount of sugar in the blood. It is usually taken by mouth, usually once or twice a day with meals. Metformin can help to lower blood sugar levels by decreasing the amount of sugar produced by the liver and increasing the sensitivity of muscle cells to insulin, which helps to move sugar from the blood into cells where it can be used for energy.\n\nMetformin may also be used in combination with other medications to treat type 2 diabetes. It is not typically used to treat type 1 diabetes, as it does not work in the same way as insulin to lower blood sugar levels.\n\nIn addition to its use in diabetes, metformin has also been studied for its potential to help with weight loss and to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in people who are at high risk for developing the disease. It may also be used off-label for other conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
