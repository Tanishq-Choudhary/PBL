Why does the Double Jeopardy Clause exist ? Why are you not allowed to prosecute someone when they been pronounced not guilty , when new evidence has been found ? Please explain like I'm five.

To avoid vicious prosecution . Say there is a DA that has a real hard on for putting you behind bars . You go to trial , not guilty . So he just tries you again and again until he gets the outcome he was looking for . Very simplified answer , but the easiest to give !
