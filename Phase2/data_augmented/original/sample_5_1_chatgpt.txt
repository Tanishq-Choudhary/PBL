where are colors on stoplight

On a traditional stoplight, the colors red, yellow, and green are typically arranged vertically, with red at the top, yellow in the middle, and green at the bottom. The red light signifies that drivers should stop and not proceed through the intersection, while the yellow light indicates that the signal is about to change to red and drivers should prepare to stop. The green light indicates that it is safe for drivers to proceed through the intersection. Some stoplights may also have additional colors or signals, such as a flashing red or yellow light, which indicate different instructions for drivers.
