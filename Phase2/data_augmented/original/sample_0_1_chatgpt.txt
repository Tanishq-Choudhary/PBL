what composer used sound mass

Sound mass is a compositional technique that involves the use of dense clusters of sound to create a harmonically and timbrally rich texture. It was first developed by the French composer Edgard Varèse in the early 20th century and has been used by many other composers since then. Some other composers who have used sound mass in their works include Karlheinz Stockhausen, Gyorgy Ligeti, and Iannis Xenakis.
