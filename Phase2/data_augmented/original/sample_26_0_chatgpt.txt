Pro - Union vs. Anti - Union arguments . Why is there so much controversy in America surrounding support or opposition of unions ? Please explain like I'm five.

Unions are organizations that workers can join to advocate for better working conditions, wages, and benefits. Some people believe that unions are important because they help workers have a stronger voice in the workplace and can help improve the lives of workers. Other people believe that unions can be harmful because they can make it harder for companies to do business and can lead to higher prices for goods and services. 
The controversy surrounding unions in America often stems from differing beliefs about the role of government and business in society. Some people believe that the government should do more to protect the rights of workers and that unions are an important way to do this. Others believe that the government should stay out of business decisions and that unions can get in the way of a company's ability to be competitive and successful. 
There are also often differing beliefs about the role of unions in the economy. Some people believe that unions help to create a more balanced distribution of wealth and power, while others believe that unions can hurt the economy by making it harder for companies to operate and compete.
