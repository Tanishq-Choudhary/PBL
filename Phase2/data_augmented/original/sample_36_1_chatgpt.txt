what are use taxes?

Use taxes are taxes that are imposed on the use, storage, or consumption of goods and certain services in a jurisdiction in which the goods or services are not taxed at the time of sale. Use taxes are generally imposed at the same rate as the sales tax in a jurisdiction, and they are typically intended to prevent businesses and individuals from avoiding sales taxes by purchasing goods and services from out-of-state or online retailers that do not charge sales tax.\n\nUse taxes are typically applied to goods that are purchased from out-of-state sellers or online retailers and brought into a jurisdiction for use, storage, or consumption. They may also be applied to services that are consumed in a jurisdiction but not taxed at the time of purchase. For example, if you purchase a product from an online retailer that is located in another state and have it shipped to your home in a jurisdiction that imposes a sales tax, you may be required to pay a use tax on the purchase.\n\nUse taxes are generally the responsibility of the purchaser to pay, and they are typically required to be reported and paid on a use tax return. Some jurisdictions may require businesses to register for a use tax permit and file use tax returns on a regular basis.
