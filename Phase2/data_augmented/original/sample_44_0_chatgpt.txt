Why is NASA 's Space / launch center based in Florida ? As compared to any other state . Please explain like I'm five.

NASA, which stands for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is based in Florida for a few reasons. One reason is because Florida is close to the equator, which makes it easier to launch rockets into space. This is because the Earth's rotation is faster at the equator, which means that rockets can get a little extra "boost" when they launch. 
Another reason is because Florida has a long history with space travel. The first American astronaut, Alan Shepard, launched into space from Florida in 1961. Since then, many other important space missions have launched from Florida, including the Apollo missions to the Moon and the space shuttle program. 
Finally, Florida has a lot of open space and good weather, which makes it a good place to test and launch rockets. The Kennedy Space Center, which is located on the east coast of Florida, is the main launch site for NASA and has been used for many important space missions. 
So, in short, Florida is a good place for NASA to launch rockets because it's close to the equator, has a long history with space travel, and has a lot of open space and good weather.
