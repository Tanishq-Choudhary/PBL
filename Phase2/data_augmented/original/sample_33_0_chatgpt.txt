Why is Monsanto considered to be such an evil company by so many people ? What have they done ? What are they currently doing ? Please explain like I'm five.

Monsanto is a company that produces agricultural products, including seeds and chemicals. Some people believe that Monsanto is an evil company because they have been involved in several controversial practices. 
One reason some people view Monsanto as evil is because they have been accused of producing genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that may have negative impacts on the environment and human health. These GMOs are plants or animals that have had their DNA altered in a laboratory in order to give them certain desired traits, such as resistance to pests or the ability to grow in certain conditions. Some people are concerned that these genetically modified organisms could harm the natural environment and have unintended consequences for human health. 
Another reason some people view Monsanto as evil is because the company has been accused of using questionable tactics to promote their products and protect their patents. For example, Monsanto has been accused of suing farmers who saved and replanted seeds from their crops, even though this is a common practice among farmers. The company has also been accused of attempting to influence the scientific research and regulatory processes related to their products. 
Monsanto is no longer a standalone company. In 2018, it was acquired by the pharmaceutical company Bayer.
