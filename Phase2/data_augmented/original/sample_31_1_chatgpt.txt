how does lsd impact the human body

LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is a powerful psychoactive drug that can alter your perception, mood, and thoughts. It is a synthetic substance that is derived from a chemical found in a type of fungus called ergot. LSD is typically taken orally, either by swallowing a tablet or by dropping a liquid solution onto the tongue.\n\nWhen you take LSD, it causes changes in the levels of certain chemicals in your brain, particularly serotonin. This can lead to a range of effects on your body and mind, including:\n\nAltered perception: LSD can cause you to see, hear, and feel things differently. You may experience hallucinations, distorted visual and auditory perceptions, and changes in the way you perceive time and space.\n\nMood changes: LSD can cause mood swings, including feelings of euphoria, happiness, and contentment, as well as feelings of anxiety, fear, and panic.\n\nIncreased energy and alertness: Some people who take LSD may feel more energetic and alert, while others may feel tired and lethargic.\n\nDilation of pupils: LSD can cause your pupils to dilate, or become larger.\n\nChanges in body temperature and blood pressure: LSD can cause changes in body temperature and blood pressure, leading to feelings of heat or cold, as well as dizziness or fainting.\n\nSweating and tremors: LSD can cause sweating and tremors, as well as changes in appetite and sleep patterns.\n\nIt's important to note that the effects of LSD can be unpredictable and can vary greatly from person to person. The drug can also cause long-term changes in the brain, including changes in personality and behavior.\n\nUsing LSD can be dangerous, and it is illegal in many countries. It can cause serious mental health problems and can be addictive. If you or someone you know is struggling with substance abuse, it's important to seek help as soon as possible.
