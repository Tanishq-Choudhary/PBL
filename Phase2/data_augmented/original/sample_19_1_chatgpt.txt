how many percent is a basis point

A basis point is a unit of measure used to express the percentage change in the value or rate of something. One basis point is equal to 0.01% or 1/100th of a percent. For example, if something increases by 50 basis points, it means that it has increased by 50/100 or 0.50%. If something decreases by 25 basis points, it means that it has decreased by 25/100 or 0.25%.
