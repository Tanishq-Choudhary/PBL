Literary Modernism is a transformative movement in literature that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, characterized by a deliberate break from traditional forms and conventions in favor of innovative techniques and experimental approaches. Rooted in the profound social, cultural, and technological changes of the era—such as industrialization, urbanization, World War I, and the advent of psychoanalysis—Modernism sought to capture the fragmented, disillusioned, and rapidly evolving nature of modern life. The movement spanned roughly from the 1890s to the mid-20th century and included a diverse array of writers, poets, and playwrights across Europe and the Americas. Key figures of Literary Modernism include James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Franz Kafka, Marcel Proust, and William Faulkner, among others.

Modernist literature is marked by its emphasis on subjectivity, interiority, and the exploration of consciousness, often employing techniques such as stream of consciousness, nonlinear narratives, and fragmented structures. These methods aimed to reflect the complexity and ambiguity of human experience in a world increasingly defined by uncertainty and upheaval. Themes of alienation, existential angst, the loss of traditional values, and the search for meaning in a seemingly chaotic world are central to Modernist works. For example, James Joyce's Ulysses (1922) uses stream of consciousness to delve into the minds of its characters, while T.S. Eliot's poem The Waste Land (1922) juxtaposes fragmented imagery and allusions to depict the spiritual desolation of the post-war era.

The movement also embraced a self-conscious awareness of its own artistry, often challenging readers to engage with texts in new and demanding ways. Modernist writers frequently rejected straightforward storytelling in favor of ambiguity, symbolism, and open-ended interpretations. Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway (1925) and To the Lighthouse (1927) exemplify this approach, using intricate narrative techniques to explore the inner lives of characters and the passage of time. Similarly, Franz Kafka's works, such as The Metamorphosis (1915) and The Trial (1925), employ surreal and allegorical elements to critique bureaucracy, identity, and the human condition.

Literary Modernism was not confined to prose and poetry; it also influenced drama, with playwrights like Samuel Beckett and Bertolt Brecht pushing the boundaries of theatrical conventions. Beckett's Waiting for Godot (1953), for instance, epitomizes the absurdist tendencies of Modernism, using minimalism and existential themes to question the nature of existence and communication.

The movement's legacy is profound, shaping the trajectory of 20th-century literature and influencing subsequent movements such as Postmodernism. Modernism's emphasis on experimentation, its exploration of the human psyche, and its engagement with the complexities of modernity continue to resonate in contemporary literature. By challenging traditional forms and embracing the fragmented nature of modern experience, Literary Modernism redefined the possibilities of artistic expression and remains a cornerstone of literary history.
