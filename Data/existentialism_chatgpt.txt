Existentialism is a philosophical movement that explores the nature of human existence, emphasizing individual freedom, choice, and responsibility in an often indifferent or absurd universe. Emerging in the 19th and 20th centuries through thinkers like Søren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Albert Camus, existentialism rejects the idea of an inherent essence or predetermined purpose in life, asserting that individuals must create their own meaning. It grapples with themes of anxiety, alienation, and authenticity, often portraying human beings as free yet burdened by the weight of their choices. While some existentialists, like Kierkegaard, incorporated religious perspectives, others, like Sartre, viewed existence as entirely without divine guidance. The movement has significantly influenced literature, psychology, and the arts, shaping works that reflect the struggle for identity and meaning in an uncertain world.
